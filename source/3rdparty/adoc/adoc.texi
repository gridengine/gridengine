@chapter Introduction
@cindex Autodocs
@cindex Autodoc comments

The @code{ADOC} scanner creates Autodocs or Texinfo source from source code.
It is an enhanced version of Bill Koesters @code{Autodoc} program as of
21-Aug-89 which is part of C=ommodore's Native Developer Kit (NDK).

@code{ADOC} scans the input files for a special kind of comments: the autodoc
comments.  Autodoc comments start at the begining of a line with a
string of the form

@example
?***??* lib/fun @dots{}
@end example

The @samp{?} stands for characters which are ignored, they must however
be ``black'', i.e. they must not be tabs or spaces.  The @samp{*} ist ment
literally, so in these places there must be an asterisk.  @samp{lib/fun}
is the identifier which specifies the library and the name of the
function described in the following comment.  @samp{lib} and @samp{fun} consist
of upper- and/or lower case letters, decimal digits, a dash @samp{-} and/or
the underscore @samp{_}.  The rest of the line is ignored.

E.g.:@: A standard C language autodoc comment begins like this:

@example
/****** mylib/myfun **************************
@end example


The following lines make up the function description, a sequence of
one or more sections.  A section begins with the section heading, a
line with only --- and at least two --- capital letters.  Some common
section headings are

@example
NAME, SYNOPSIS, FUNCTION, INPUTS, RESULT, @dots{}
@end example

Each line in the function description must be prefixed with a black
character followed by at least one white space or the end of the line.
An autodoc comment ends with a line beginning with a black character
followed by at least two asterisks @samp{*}.  An example template comment
can be found at the end of this document.

@cindex Command line
@cindex Switchs

@code{ADOC} reads the command line from left to right and collects
filenames and options before it starts processing your input.
The filenames are queued and processed in the same order as they
appear in the command line.  The list-file option @samp{@@} is replaced
by the contents of the list file read in top-down order. If no input
files are specified @code{ADOC} will read from the standard input stream.

@c %--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Autodoc Options
@section Options for the @code{Autodoc} output

@table @code

@item --autodoc
@pindex --autodoc
@code{ADOC} creates an autodoc file. (This is the default)

@item --no-form-feeds
@pindex --no-form-feeds
Usually the functions in @code{ADOC}s autodoc output are seperated by form feeds (@kbd{^L}).  
With this switch @code{ADOC} omits them.
(This switch is a no-op in @samp{--texinfo} mode).

@item --table-of-contents
@pindex --table-of-contents
A table of contents is written to the output followed by the autodoc functions.  
Functions and toc-entries are always in the same order, so @samp{--preserve-order} 
also affects the table of contents.
(This switch is a no-op in @samp{--texinfo} mode).

@item --preserve-order
@pindex --preserve-order
With this option @code{ADOC} does not sort the functions before writing the autodoc output.
(This switch is ignored in @samp{--texinfo} mode).

@end table

@c %--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node IO Options
@section Options for @code{Autodoc} and @code{Texinfo} output

@table @code

@item --stdin
@pindex --stdin
This switch behaves like a filename for the standard input stream.
Using it does not only force reading from stdin
but you can also specify the files to read before and after the standard input.

@item --output-file @var{filename}
@pindex --output-file
This option allows you to specify a filename for @code{ADOC}'s output.
If this option is ommited @code{ADOC} will write to the standard output stream.

@item --error-file @var{filename}
@pindex --error-file
Like @samp{--output-file} this option allows you to redirect @code{ADOC}'s output.
The difference between the two is that this option redirects warnings and error messages
from stderr into the file @var{filename}.

@item --flip-slashes
@pindex --flip-slashes
This option converts @samp{\*} to @samp{/*} and @samp{*\} to @samp{*/}.
This allows C language comments in the autodocs without nesting comments in the source code.

The name of the option might give you the idea of a general conversion of backslashes into slashes.
This is however incorrect.
The character on the left or right of the @samp{\} must be an asterisk (@samp{*}).
Please note that @samp{*\*} is transformed into @samp{*/*}.

@item --tabs-to-spaces
@pindex --tabs-to-spaces
Tabs in the input are turned into spaces with a default tab size of 8.
This is the default in @samp{--texinfo} mode.

@item --tabsize @var{number}
@pindex --tabsize
The tab size is changed to @var{number}.  (default is @samp{--tabsize 8}).
This option implies @samp{--tabs-to-spaces}.

@item --line-length @var{number}
@pindex --line-length
Function headers in the autodoc output will be @var{number}
columns wide.  (default is @samp{--line-length 80}).
(This option has no influence on @code{ADOC}'s Texinfo output).

@item --internal
@pindex --internal
@code{ADOC} will only read comments with an @samp{i} in column 5 or 6.
(same as @samp{--yank-type "i"}).

@item --yank-type @var{type}
@pindex --yank-type
@code{ADOC} will only read comments which have in column 5 or 6
one of the chatacters in the @var{type} string.

@item --indented-comments
@pindex --indented-comments
The autodoc comments normally have to start at column 1, i.e.:@: they
must not be indented.  This option allows indented comments, but it
does not check whether or not the indentation of all comment lines
is equal or not.

Additionally, if the indentation is not a multiple of @code{ADOC}'s tab size,
the conversion of @key{TAB} characters into spaces might lead to wrong results.
This is due to the fact that @code{ADOC} does not remember the columnar position
of each body text line but silently assumes that they all start at a tab stop column.

In general it is @strong{not} recommended to make use of @key{TAB}s in indented comments.
If you really insist on them you can pipe these files through @code{expand} and @code{ADOC}'s
output through @code{unexpand}:

@example
$ cat *.c | expand -t8 | adoc -I | unexpand -t8 -a > adoc.out
@end example

@item --reindent-bodytext @var{number}
@pindex --reindent-bodytext
This option changes the indentation of lines in the body text of all
functions to @var{number} spaces.  If @var{number} is 0 then the
current indentation is removed which is default in @samp{--texinfo} mode.

In order to remove the current indentation @code{ADOC} cuts a columnar 
block beginning at column 1 from the function body.
The width of this block is the maximum width without hurting any text.

There is one more thing to mention:  This option automatically converts
all @key{TAB} characters into the apropriate number of spaces.  You want
this because the new indentation might destroy your textual layout otherwise.
The conversion is performed before the removal of the indentation.

If you want to change the body text indentation via @samp{--reindent-bodytext} but
insist on having @key{TAB} characters instead of spaces then you have to pipe the 
@code{ADOC} output through @code{unexpand}:

@example
$ adoc -I *.c | unexpand -t8 -a > adoc.out
@end example

@item --preserve-indentation
@pindex --preserve-indentation
This option avoids reindentation of the body text (e.g.:@: in @samp{--texinfo} mode
where @samp{--reindent-bodytext 0} is @code{ADOC}'s default).

@item --sort-entries
@pindex --sort-entries
This option forces sorting of the functions which is default in both
@samp{--autodoc} and @samp{--texinfo} mode.

@item -M@var{macro} @var{value}
@pindex -M
Defines a value @var{value} for a macro @var{macro} which is expanded
when writing the body text of a function.  (e.g.:@: the above
mentioned conversions of for @samp{--flip-slashes} and @samp{--texinfo}
are implemented in this manner).

Note that there must @strong{not} be a space between @samp{-M} and the
name (i.e.@: the source string) of the macro.

@item -U @var{macro}
@pindex -U
Undefines a macro @var{macro} no matter whether @var{macro} had been
defined with @samp{-D} or @samp{-M} or not at all.

@end table

@c %--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Texinfo Options
@section Options for @code{Texinfo} output

@table @code

@item --texinfo
@pindex --texinfo
Write texinfo source instead of autodocs.  This switch implies
@samp{--tabs-to-spaces}. @samp{--preserve-order} and @samp{--no-form-feeds}
are ignored.  The functions in the texinfo output are always
sorted, tabs are always expanded and there will be no form
feeds.

Some conversions will be performed on your autodoc body text,
especially:

@example
@@  ->  @@@@
@{  ->  @@@{
@}  ->  @@@}
@end example

@item --project
@itemx --revision
@itemx --edition
@itemx --copyright
@itemx --author
@pindex --project
@pindex --revision
@pindex --edition
@pindex --copyright
@pindex --author
@code{ADOC}'s texinfo header reserves these four macros.  Their
value defaults to their name.  @samp{--project} is not only used
on the title page but also as the name for the @file{.info} or
@file{.guide} file.

These options actually define the macros
@code{PROJECT}, @code{EDTITION}, @code{REVISION}, @code{COPYRIGHT} and @code{AUTHOR}
as if they had been defined via @samp{-D}.

@item --no-references
@pindex --no-references
In @samp{--texinfo} mode, @code{ADOC} tries to find matching nodes for
the identifiers in the @code{SEE ALSO} section.  You can however
force @code{ADOC} to write this section as it is by giving this
switch.

Best results can be obtained by writing one reference per
line in the same @samp{lib/fun} format as in the header line of
the referenced function.  @code{ADOC} will however try to prepend
the current functions library name to the identifiers and
removes parens, commata, white spaces and newline characters
in order to find the referenced @samp{lib/fun} header.

@item --parse-references
@pindex --parse-references
This option prints one "See ..." sentence containing all references
from the @code{SEE ALSO} section.  No itemization is used.

The name of this option might insinuate the necessity of passing
it together with other options which need to analyze the @code{SEE ALSO}
section.  This is however incorrect.  The name of this option is somehow
an archaic requilict from those times where @code{ADOC} learned to look
closer at it's input.  
It could also be called @samp{--make-one-sentence-of-references} or something
similar.


@item --itemize-references
@pindex --itemize-references
@code{ADOC} puts the parsed references as an @code{@@item} into an @code{@@itemize}
environment.  (This is default in @samp{--texinfo} mode).

Parsing the references is done automatically, even if you guess that
you need the @samp{--parse-references} option.  This not a good guess.
Perhaps you should better look at the above description of this option.


@item --no-grouping
@pindex --no-grouping
@code{ADOC} will not make use of texinfo's grouping feature.
(This is the default).

@item --group-sections
@pindex --group-sections
The section body (following the title keyword) will be grouped
into a @code{@@group} @dots{} @code{@@end group} environment in order to prevent
@TeX{} from breaking the page inside a section.   The current
implementation of @code{texinfo} does not allow placing the section
keyword into the @code{@@group} as well:

@example
! @@group invalid in context where filling is enabled.
@end example

@item --body-environment @var{string}
@pindex --body-environment
This option allows you to specify the texinfo environment into
which the section body text will be placed.  The internal
default is @samp{--body-environment smallexample} and so each
section body is placed into an environment of the form

@example
@@smallexample
  <body text>
@@end smallexample
@end example

If @samp{--group-sections} is specified, then this @code{@@group} is placed
into the given environment like this:

@example
@@smallexample
@@group
  <body text>
@@end group
@@end smallexample
@end example

Please note that this environment is not used within parsed
references in the @code{SEE ALSO} section.

@item --texi-funtable
@pindex --texi-funtable
This switch tells the texinfo code generator to place a
function into a @code{@@table} environment with each section keyword
as a @code{@@b@{@}}old @code{@@item}.  This might however look ugly and lead to an
immense amount of overfull @code{\hbox@{@}}es because @TeX{} will then
indent the following body text twice (for the @code{@@item} and for
the @code{@@example}) and so @code{ADOC}'s default is to write a section
keyword like an ordinary, indented, @code{@@b@{@}}old paragraph.

@item --form-feeds
@pindex --form-feeds
With this option a page break is forced by inserting a @code{@@page}
command in front of each function description.  An exception is
the first function of a library which always begins on the
same page as the library @code{@@chapter}.

@item --texi-header-file @var{filename}
@pindex --texi-header-file
@code{ADOC} comes up with a minimal header and titlepage when writing
texinfo output.  This option allows you to replace @code{ADOC}'s
internal header with the contents of @var{filename}.

Note that a macro expansion of macros defined via @samp{-D} will be
performed on the contents of @var{filename}.

@item --no-texi-header
@pindex --no-texi-header
This option forces @code{ADOC} to ommit writing a texinfo header and
a title page.  Texinfo output begins with the (Top) @code{@@menu}.

@item --no-texi-index
@pindex --no-texi-index
No function index and no table of contents is used in the texinfo file.

@item -D@var{macro} @var{value}
@pindex -D
Defines a value @var{value} for a macro @var{macro} which is expanded
when writing the texinfo header.  These definitions are @strong{not}
performed on the body text of a function description like
those defined via @samp{-M}.

Note that there must @strong{not} be a space between @samp{-D} and the
name of the macro.

This chapter is under development.

@section How @code{ADOC} reads your input

@code{ADOC} scanns your input for autodoc comments.
These comments begin on the leftmost column in a new line which most likely looks
like one of those:

@table @code
@item /****** mylib/myfun ******
This is the beginning of a standard C or Rexx Language autodoc comment for the function
@code{myfun} in the library or module @code{mylib}.

@item ;****** mylib/myfun ******
@itemx ******* mylib/myfun ******
Most assemblers use a semicolon (@samp{;}) or an asterisk (@samp{*}) to begin a remark.

@item #****** mylib/myfun ******
This type is known in Makefiles and shell scripts.

@item %****** mylib/myfun ******
For autodoc comments in @TeX{} or @code{METAFONT} we need the percent sign (@samp{%}).
@end table

When @code{ADOC} encounters the beginning of an autodoc comment it starts collecting section headings
and body text lines and saves them for later use in the code generator.

The lines inside autodoc comments must be prefixed by a black character.
This character is made invisible in the output.  To be more precise:
@code{ADOC} removes the black character in column 1 if the following character is a
@key{TAB} or a newline character but it replaces it by a space if the following character is a space character.

Each line which contains entirely capitalized letters is assumed to be a section
heading unless it contains only one single upper case character.

The indentation of section headings and body text lines does not matter.
You should however use an indentation of 3 spaces for a section heading
and 7 spaces for body text lines.
Note that @code{ADOC} allows you to adjust the indentation for the output via
the @samp{--reindent-bodytext} option.

@section Example comment
Here is a sample ``correct'' autodoc comment taken from the @file{autodoc.style}
which is part of Commodore's Native Developer Kit (NDK):

@end smallexample

There are three spaces from the @samp{*} to the start of each @code{HEADING}.
There is one tab after the @samp{*} before the start of the body text.
No other tabs are used.

Note that @code{ADOC} also allows the use of spaces to indent body text lines.
You can even mix tabs and spaces!  (We recommend to avoid @key{TAB} characters.)

@section General style notes

@itemize @bullet
@item
It is critical that changes be noted in a sane manner.

@item
When referring to a function, the standard format is @code{FunctionName()}.

@item
Capitalization should be correct.  Here are some guidelines:

@enumerate
@item
Trademarks, @strong{must} be capitalized.

@item
Names of ``things'' are as defined.
For example, @code{OpenWindow()}, and ``a @code{Window} structure''.
``fiddles with your window'' does not refer to the structure, and should not be capitalized.
@end enumerate

@item
Lines terminate at column 79, so the autodocs are readable from within an 80 column window.
@end itemize

For further guidelines refer to @file{autodoc.style} --- Commodore's autodoc style guide
which is part of the Native Developer Kit (NDK).

@cindex Compatibility

@itemize @minus
@item
Most of @code{ADOC}'s ``short'' options are compatible with Bill Koester's
@code{Autodoc} Program.  @samp{-C}, @samp{-s}, @samp{-a}, @samp{-F}, @samp{-r} and @samp{-w} are
ignored for compatibility.

@item
This documentation is far from being complete

@item
Most of the options are not tested

@item
The @samp{-M} option actually does not affect the @code{SEE ALSO} section in
texinfo source if parsing is enabled.  This might change in the
future when using @code{funexpand()}.

@item
@TeX{} will not break a page inside of indented paragraphs in @code{@@example} or
@code{@@smallexample} blocks.  The result might look ugly.
