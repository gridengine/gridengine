.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Qdel
provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete
one or more jobs. 
.I Qdel
deletes jobs in the order in which their job 
identifiers are presented. Find additional information concerning
\fIwc_user_list\fP and \fIwc_job_list\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.IP "\fB\-f\fP"
Force action for running jobs. The job(s) are deleted from the list of
jobs registered at
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
even if the
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
controlling the job(s) does not respond to the delete request sent by
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8 .
.PP
Users which are neither xxQS_NAMExx managers nor operators can only use the
.B \-f
option (for their own jobs) if the cluster configuration entry
.B qmaster_params
contains the flag ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_conf 5 ).
However, behavior for administrative and
non-administrative users differs. Jobs are deleted from the xxQS_NAMExx
database immediately in case of administrators. Otherwise, a regular
deletion is attempted first and a forced cancellation is only executed if
the regular deletion was unsuccessful.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a listing of all options.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-u wc_user_list\fP"
Deletes only those jobs which were submitted by
users specified in the list of usernames.
For managers it is possible to use \fB\qdel -u "*"\fP to delete
all jobs of all users. If a manager wants to delete a specific
job of a user, he has to specify the user and the job. If no 
job is specified all jobs from that user are deleted.
.\"
.IP "\fBwc_job_range_list\fP"
A list of jobs, which should be deleted
.\"
.\"
.SH "ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES"
.\" 
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT\fP" 1.5i
Specifies the location of the xxQS_NAMExx standard configuration
files.
.\"
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the default xxQS_NAMExx cell. To address a xxQS_NAMExx
cell
.I qdel
uses (in the order of precedence):
.sp 1
.RS
.RS
The name of the cell specified in the environment 
variable xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL, if it is set.
.sp 1
The name of the default cell, i.e. \fBdefault\fP.
.sp 1
.RE
.RE
.\"
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_DEBUG_LEVEL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies that debug information
should be written to stderr. In addition the level of
detail in which debug information is generated is defined.
.\"
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_QMASTER_PORT\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the tcp port on which
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
is expected to listen for communication requests.
Most installations will use a services map entry for the
service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
