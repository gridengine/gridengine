DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qsub</I> submits batch jobs to the Grid Engine  queuing  system.
     Grid Engine supports single- and multiple-node jobs. Command
     can be a path to a binary or a script (see -b  below)  which
     contains  the  commands  to  be run by the job using a shell
     (for example, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>).  Arguments  to  the  command
     are given as command_args to <I>qsub</I> . If command is handled as
     a script then it is possible to embed flags in  the  script.
     If  the  first  two characters of a script line either match
     '#$' or are equal to the prefix string defined with  the  -C
     option described below, the line is parsed for embedded com-
     mand flags.

     <I>Qsh</I> submits an interactive X-windows session to Grid Engine.
     An  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>  is  brought up from the executing machine with
     the display directed either to the X-server indicated by the
     DISPLAY  environment  variable  or  as  specified  with  the
     -<I>display</I> <I>qsh</I> option. Interactive jobs are not spooled if  no
     resource  is  available  to  execute  them.  They are either
     dispatched to a suitable machine for  execution  immediately
     or  the  user  submitting  the  job  is notified by <I>qsh</I> that
     appropriate resources to execute the job are not  available.
     xterm_args are passed to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> executable.

     <I>Qlogin</I> is similar to <I>qsh</I> in that it submits  an  interactive
     job  to  the  queueing  system. It does not open an <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>
     window on the X display, but uses the current  terminal  for
     user I/O. Usually, <I>qlogin</I> establishes a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B> connection
     with the remote host, using standard client- and server-side
     commands.   These   commands  can  be  configured  with  the
     qlogin_daemon (server-side, Grid Engine <I>telnetd</I> if not  set,
     otherwise    something    like   /usr/sbin/in.telnetd)   and
     qlogin_command (client-side, Grid Engine <I>telnet</I> if not  set,
     otherwise  something like /usr/bin/telnet) parameters in the
     global and local configuration settings of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.  The
     client  side command is automatically parameterized with the
     remote host name  and  port  number  to  which  to  connect,
     resulting in an invocation like

          /usr/bin/telnet my_exec_host 2442

     for example.  <I>Qlogin</I> is invoked exactly  like  <I>qsh</I>  and  its
     jobs  can  only  run on INTERACTIVE queues.  <I>Qlogin</I> jobs can
     only be used if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is running under  the  root
     account.

     <I>Qrsh</I> is similar to <I>qlogin</I> in that it submits an  interactive
     job  to the queuing system. It uses the current terminal for
     user I/O. Usually, <I>qrsh</I> establishes a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> connection with
     the  remote  host.  If  no command is given to <I>qrsh</I>, an <I>rlo-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/gin.html">gin(1)</A></B> session is  established.   The  server-side  commands
     used can be configured with the rsh_daemon and rlogin_daemon
     parameters in the global and local configuration settings of
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.   An Grid Engine <I>rshd</I> or <I>rlogind</I> is used if the
     parameters are not set. If  the  parameters  are  set,  they
     should   be  set  to  something  like  /usr/sbin/in.rshd  or
     /usr/sbin/in.rlogind.  On the client-side,  the  rsh_command
     and  rlogin_command  parameters can be set in the global and
     local configuration settings of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.   If  they  are
     not  set,  special Grid Engine <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> binaries
     delivered with Grid Engine are used.  Use the cluster confi-
     guration  parameters to integrate mechanisms like <I>ssh</I> or the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> facilities supplied with the  operating
     system.

     <I>Qrsh</I> jobs can only run  in  INTERACTIVE  queues  unless  the
     option  -now  no is used (see below).  They can also only be
     run, if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is running under the root account.

     <I>Qrsh</I> provides an additional useful feature  for  integrating
     with  interactive  tools providing a specific command shell.
     If the environment variable QRSH_WRAPPER is set when <I>qrsh</I> is
     invoked,  the command interpreter pointed to by QRSH_WRAPPER
     will be executed to run <I>qrsh</I> commands instead of  the  users
     login shell or any shell specified in the <I>qrsh</I> command-line.

     <I>Qalter</I> can be used to change the attributes of pending jobs.
     Once a job is executing, changes are no longer possible. For
     array jobs, for which a part of the tasks can be pending and
     another  part  can  be  running  (see  the -t option below),
     modifications with <I>qalter</I> only  affect  the  pending  tasks.
     <I>Qalter</I>  can change most of the characteristics of a job (see
     the corresponding statements in the OPTIONS section  below),
     including  those which were defined as embedded flags in the
     script file (see above).

     <I>Qresub</I> allows the user to create jobs as copies of  existing
     pending  or  running jobs. The copied jobs will have exactly
     the same attributes as the ones from which they were copied,
     except for a new job ID. The only modification to the copied
     jobs supported by qresub is assignment of a hold state  with
     the -h option. This can be used to first copy a job and then
     change its attributes via <I>qalter</I>.

     For <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> the  administrator  and  the
     user  may  define default request files (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_request.html">sge_request(5)</A></B>)
     which can contain any of the options described below.  If an
     option  in  a default request file is understood by <I>qsub</I> and
     <I>qlogin</I> but not by <I>qsh</I> the option is silently ignored if  <I>qsh</I>
     is  invoked.  Thus  you  can maintain shared default request
     files for both <I>qsub</I> and <I>qsh</I>.

     A cluster wide default request  file  may  be  placed  under
     $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request.      User    private
     default request files  are  processed  under  the  locations
     $HOME/.sge_request and $cwd/.sge_request. The working direc-
     tory local default request file has the highest  precedence,
     then  the  home  directory located file and then the cluster
     global file.  The  option  arguments,  the  embedded  script
     flags  and the options in the default request files are pro-
     cessed in the following order:

          left to right in the script line,
          left to right in the default request files,
          from top to bottom of the script file (<I>qsub</I> only),
          from top to bottom of default request files,
          from left to right of the command line.

     In other words, the command line can be used to override the
     embedded flags and the default request settings.  The embed-
     ded flags, however, will override the default settings.

     Note, that the -<I>clear</I> option can be used to discard any pre-
     vious settings at any time in a default request file, in the
     embedded script flags, or in a command-line option.  It  is,
     however, not available with <I>qalter</I>.

     The options described below can be requested either hard  or
     soft.   By  default,  all requests are considered hard until
     the -soft option (see below) is encountered.  The  hard/soft
     status  remains  in  effect until its counterpart is encoun-
     tered again.  If all the hard requests for a job  cannot  be
     met,  the  job  will not be scheduled.  Jobs which cannot be
     run at the present time remain spooled.

OPTIONS
     -@ optionfile
          Forces <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, or <I>qlogin</I> to  use  the  options
          contained in optionfile. The indicated file may contain
          all valid options. Comment lines must start with a  "#"
          sign.

     -a date_time
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the time and date at which  a  job
          is   eligible  for  execution.  Date_time  conforms  to
          [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm.[ss], where:

          CC  denotes the century in 2 digits.
          YY  denotes the year in 2 digits.
          MM  denotes the month in 2 digits.
          DD  denotes the day in 2 digits.
          hh  denotes the hour in 2 digits.
          mm  denotes the minute in 2 digits.
          ss  denotes the seconds in 2 digits (default 00).

          If any of the optional  date  fields  is  omitted,  the
          corresponding  value of the current date is assumed. If
          CC is not specified, a YY of &lt; 70 means 20YY.
          Usage of this option may cause  unexpected  results  if
          the clocks of the hosts in the Grid Engine pool are out
          of sync. Also, the proper behavior of this option  very
          much  depends on the correct setting of the appropriate
          timezone, e.g. in  the  TZ  environment  variable  (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/date.html">date(1)</A></B>  for  details),  when  the  Grid Engine daemons
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> are invoked.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -ac variable[=value],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Adds the given name/value pair(s) to the job's context.
          Value  may  be  omitted.  Grid Engine appends the given
          argument to the list of context variables for the  job.
          Multiple  -ac,  -dc, and -sc options may be given.  The
          order is important here.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -A account_string
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Identifies the account to which the  resource  consump-
          tion  of  the job should be charged. The account_string
          may be any arbitrary ASCII alphanumeric string but  may
          not contain  "\n", "\t", "\r", "/", ":", "@", "\", "*",
          or "?".  In the absence of this parameter  Grid  Engine
          will  place  the  default  account  string "sge" in the
          accounting record of the job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -b y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I> only. <I>Qalter</I>  does  not  allow
          changing this option. This option cannot be embedded in
          the script file itself.

          Gives the user the possibility to  indicate  explicitly
          whether  command should be treated as binary or script.
          If the value of -b is  'y',  then  command   may  be  a
          binary  or script.  The command might not be accessible
          from the submission host.  Nothing except the  path  of
          the command will be transfered from the submission host
          to the execution host. Path aliasing will be applied to
          the path of command before command will be executed.

          If the value of -b is 'n' then command needs  to  be  a
          script  and  it  will  be handled as script. The script
          file has to be accessible by the  submission  host.  It
          will  be  transfered  to  the execution host. <I>qsub</I>/<I>qrsh</I>
          will search directive prefixes within script.

          <I>qsub</I> will implicitely use -b n whereas <I>qrsh</I> will  apply
          the -b y option if nothing else is specified.

     -c occasion_specifier
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines whether the job should  be  check-
          pointed,  and  if  so,  under  what  circumstances. The
          specification of the checkpointing occasions with  this
          option overwrites the definitions of the <I>when</I> parameter
          in the checkpointing  environment  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>)
          referenced  by  the <I>qsub</I> -<I>ckpt</I> switch.  Possible values
          for occasion_specifier are

          n           no checkpoint is performed.
          s           checkpoint when batch server is shut down.
          m           checkpoint at minimum CPU interval.
          x           checkpoint when job gets suspended.
          &lt;interval&gt;  checkpoint in the specified time interval.

          The minimum CPU interval is defined in the queue confi-
          guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).  &lt;interval&gt;
          has to be specified in the format hh:mm:ss.   The  max-
          imum of &lt;interval&gt; and the queue's minimum CPU interval
          is used if &lt;interval&gt; is specified.  This  is  done  to
          ensure  that a machine is not overloaded by checkpoints
          being generated too frequently.

     -ckpt ckpt_name
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Selects  the  checkpointing  environment  (see   <I>check-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/point.html">point(5)</A></B>)  to  be  used for checkpointing the job. Also
          declares the job to be a checkpointing job.

     -clear
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> only.

          Causes all elements of the job to be reset to the  ini-
          tial default status prior to applying any modifications
          (if any) appearing in this specific command.

     -cwd Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Execute the job from  the  current  working  directory.
          This  switch  will activate Grid Engine's path aliasing
          facility, if the corresponding configuration files  are
          present (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_aliases.html">sge_aliases(5)</A></B>).

          In the case of <I>qalter</I>, the previous definition  of  the
          current working directory will be overwritten if <I>qalter</I>
          is executed from a different directory than the preced-
          ing <I>qsub</I> or <I>qalter</I>.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -C prefix_string
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and qrsh with script submission  (-b
          n).

          <I>Prefix</I>_<I>string</I>  defines  the  prefix  that  declares   a
          directive in the job's command. The prefix is not a job
          attribute, but affects the behavior of <I>qsub</I>  and  <I>qrsh</I>.
          If  prefix  is  a  null string, the command will not be
          scanned for embedded directives.
          The directive prefix consists of two  ASCII  characters
          which,  when  appearing  in  the  first  two bytes of a
          script line, indicate that  what  follows  is  an  Grid
          Engine command.  The default is "#$".
          The user should be aware that changing the first delim-
          iting character can produce unforeseen side effects. If
          the script file contains  anything  other  than  a  "#"
          character  in  the first byte position of the line, the
          shell processor for the job will reject  the  line  and
          may exit the job prematurely.
          If the -C option is present in the script file,  it  is
          ignored.

     -dc variable,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Removes the given variable(s) from the  job's  context.
          Multiple  -ac,  -dc, and -sc options may be given.  The
          order is important.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -display display_specifier
          Available for <I>qsh</I> only.

          Directs <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> to use display_specifier in  order  to
          contact  the  X  server.   The display_specifier has to
          contain the hostname part of  the  display  name  (e.g.
          myhost:1). Local display names (e.g. :0) cannot be used
          in grid environments.  Values  set  with  the  -display
          option  overwrite settings from the submission environ-
          ment and from -v commandline options.

     -dl date_time
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Specifies   the    deadline    initiation    time    in
          [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] format (see -a option above). The
          deadline initiation time is the time at which  a  dead-
          line  job  has to reach top priority to be able to com-
          plete within a given deadline. Before the deadline ini-
          tiation  time  the  priority  of a deadline job will be
          raised steadily until it reaches the maximum as config-
          ured by the Grid Engine administrator.
          This option is applicable only  for  users  allowed  to
          submit deadline jobs.

     -e [[hostname]:]path,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the path  used  for  the  standard
          error  stream  of  the  job. If the path constitutes an
          absolute path name, the error-path attribute of the job
          is  set  to  path,  including the hostname. If the path
          name is relative, Grid Engine expands path either  with
          the  current working directory path (if the -cwd switch
          (see above) is also specified) or with the home  direc-
          tory  path.  If hostname is present, the standard error
          stream will be placed  in  the  corresponding  location
          only if the job runs on the specified host. If the path
          contains a ":" without a hostname, a leading ":" has to
          be specified.

          By default the file name for  standard  error  has  the
          form  <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.e<I>job</I>_<I>id</I> and <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.e<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>.task_id for
          array job tasks (see -t option below).

          If path is a directory, the standard  error  stream  of
          the job will be put in this directory under the default
          file name.  If the  pathname  contains  certain  pseudo
          environment  variables, their value will be expanded at
          runtime of the job and will be used to  constitute  the
          standard  error  stream path name. The following pseudo
          environment variables are supported currently:

          $HOME       home directory on execution machine
          $USER       user ID of job owner
          $JOB_ID     current job ID
          $JOB_NAME   current job name (see -N option)
          $HOSTNAME   name of the execution host
          $TASK_ID    array job task index number

          Alternatively to $HOME the tilde sign "~" can  be  used
          as common in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/ksh.html">ksh(1)</A></B>.  Note, that the "~" sign
          also works in combination  with  user  names,  so  that
          "~&lt;user&gt;"  expands  to  the  home  directory of &lt;user&gt;.
          Using another user  ID  than  that  of  the  job  owner
          requires corresponding permissions, of course.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -hard
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Signifies that all resource requirements  following  in
          the  command line will be hard requirements and must be
          satisfied in full before a job can be scheduled.
          As Grid Engine scans the command line and  script  file
          for Grid Engine options and parameters it builds a list
          of resources required  by  a  job.  All  such  resource
          requests are considered as absolutely essential for the
          job to commence. If the -soft  option  (see  below)  is
          encountered   during   the   scan  then  all  following
          resources are designated  as  "soft  requirements"  for
          execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the
          -hard flag is encountered at a later stage of the scan,
          all  resource  requests  following it once again become
          "essential". The -hard and -soft options in effect  act
          as "toggles" during the scan.

     -h | -h {u|s|o|n|U|O|S}...
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          List of holds to place on a job, a task or  some  tasks
          of a job.

          `u'  denotes a user hold.
          `s'  denotes a system hold.
          `o'  denotes a operator hold.
          `n'  denotes no hold.

          As long as any hold other than `n' is assigned  to  the
          job the job is not eligible for execution. Holds can be
          released via <I>qalter</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrls.html">qrls(1)</A></B>.   In  case  of  <I>qalter</I>
          this  is  supported  by the following additional option
          specifiers for the -h switch:

          `U'  removes a user hold.
          `S'  removes a system hold.
          `O'  removes a operator hold.

          Grid Engine managers can assign  and  remove  all  hold
          types, Grid Engine operators can assign and remove user
          and operator holds, and users can only assign or remove
          user holds.

          In the case of <I>qsub</I> only user holds can be placed on  a
          job and thus only the first form of the option with the
          -h switch alone is allowed.  As opposed to this, <I>qalter</I>
          requires the second form described above.

          An alternate means to assign hold is  provided  by  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B> facility.

          If the job is a array job (see the  -t  option  below),
          all  tasks  specified  via  -t  are  affected by the -h
          operation simultaneously.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -help
          Prints  a listing of all options.

     -hold_jid wc_job_list
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the job  dependency  list  of  the
          submitted  job.  A  reference  by  job  name or regular
          expression is only accepted if the  referenced  job  is
          owend by the same user as the refering job. The submit-
          ted job is not eligible for execution unless  all  jobs
          referenced  in  the  comma-separated  job id and/or job
          name list have completed successfully.  With  the  help
          of  job  names or regular expressions one can specify a
          job dependency on multiple jobs satisfying the  regular
          expression  or on all jobs with the requested name. The
          name dependencies are resolved at submittion  time  and
          can  only  be  changed  via  qalter.  New  jobs or name
          changes of other jobs will not be taken into account.


          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -i [[hostname]:]file,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the file  used  for  the  standard
          input  stream  of  the  job.  If the <I>file</I> constitues an
          absolute filename, the input-path attribute of the  job
          is  set  to  path,  including the hostname. If the path
          name is relative, Grid Engine expands path either  with
          the  current working directory path (if the -cwd switch
          (see above) is also specified) or with the home  direc-
          tory  path.  If hostname is present, the standard input
          stream will be placed  in  the  corresponding  location
          only if the job runs on the specified host. If the path
          contains a ":" without a hostname, a leading ":" has to
          be specified.

          By default /dev/null is the input stream for the job.

          It is possible to use certain pseudo  variables,  whose
          values  will be expanded at runtime of the job and will
          be  used  to  express  the  standard  input  stream  as
          described  in  the  -<I>e</I>  option  for  the standard error
          stream.
          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -inherit
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>.

          <I>qrsh</I> allows the user to start  a  task  in  an  already
          scheduled parallel job.  The option -inherit tells <I>qrsh</I>
          to read a job id from the environment  variable  JOB_ID
          and  start the specified command as a task in this job.
          Please note that in this case, the hostname of the host
          where  the  command  will  be executed must precede the
          command to execute; the syntax changes to

          qrsh -inherit [ other  options  ]  hostname  command  [
          command_args ]

          Note also, that  in  combination  with  -inherit,  most
          other  command  line options will be ignored.  Only the
          options -verbose, -v and -V will be interpreted.  As  a
          replacement to option -cwd please use -v PWD.

          Usually  a  task  should  have  the  same   environment
          (including   the  current  working  directory)  as  the
          corresponding job, so specifying the option  -V  should
          be suitable for most applications.

          <I>Note</I>: If in your system the qmaster  tcp  port  is  not
          configured as a service, but rather via the environment
          variable SGE_QMASTER_PORT, make sure that this variable
          is  set  in  the  enviroment when calling <I>qrsh</I> or <I>qmake</I>
          with the -inherit option. If you  call  <I>qrsh</I>  or  <I>qmake</I>
          with  the  -inherit  option  from  within a job script,
          export   SGE_QMASTER_PORT   with   the    option    "-v
          SGE_QMASTER_PORT"  either  as  a command argument or an
          embedded directive.

     -j y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Specifies whether or not the standard error  stream  of
          the job is merged into the standard output stream.
          If both the -j y and the -e options are  present,  Grid
          Engine sets but ignores the error-path attribute.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -js job_share
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.
          Defines or redefines the job share of the job  relative
          to other jobs.  Job share is an unsigned integer value.
          The default job share value for jobs is 0.

          The job share influences the Share Tree Policy and  the
          Functional  Policy. It has no effect on the Urgency and
          Override Policies (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/share_tree.html">share_tree(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> and
          the  <I>Grid</I>  <I>Engine</I> <I>Installation</I> <I>and</I> <I>Administration</I> <I>Guide</I>
          for further information on the resource management pol-
          icies supported by Grid Engine).

          In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can  distribute
          the  tickets to which they are currently entitled among
          their jobs using different shares assigned via -js.  If
          all jobs have the same job share value, the tickets are
          distributed evenly.  Otherwise,  jobs  receive  tickets
          relative  to  the  different job shares. Job shares are
          treated like an additional level in the share  tree  in
          the latter case.

          In connection with the Functional Policy, the job share
          can  be  used  to weight jobs within the functional job
          category.  Tickets  are  distributed  relative  to  any
          uneven  job  share  distribution  treated  as a virtual
          share distribution level underneath the functional  job
          category.

          If both the Share Tree and the  Functional  Policy  are
          active, the job shares will have an effect in both pol-
          icies, and the tickets independently derived in each of
          them  are added to the total number of tickets for each
          job.

     -l resource=value,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Launch the job in a Grid Engine queue meeting the given
          resource  request list.  In case of <I>qalter</I> the previous
          definition is replaced by the specified one.
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> describes how a list of available  resources
          and  their  associated  valid  value  specifiers can be
          obtained.
          There may be multiple -l switches in a single  command.
          You  may request multiple -l options to be soft or hard
          both in the same command line. In case of a serial  job
          multiple  -l  switches  refine  the  definition for the
          sought queue.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -m b|e|a|s|n,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail  is
          to  be  sent  to  the job owner or to the users defined
          with the -M option described below.  The  option  argu-
          ments have the following meaning:

          `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the job.
          `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the job.
          `a'     Mail is sent when the job is aborted or
                  rescheduled.
          `s'     Mail is sent when the job is suspended.
          `n'     No mail is sent.

          Currently no mail is sent when a job is suspended.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing the b, e, and a option arguments
          even  while the job executes. The modification of the b
          option argument will only be in effect after a  restart
          or migration of the job, however.

     -M user[@host],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the list of  users  to  which  the
          server  that  executes the job has to send mail, if the
          server sends mail about the job.  Default  is  the  job
          owner at the originating host.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -masterq wc_queue_list
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.  Only
          meaningful  for  parallel  jobs, i.e. together with the
          -pe option.

          Defines or redefines a list of  cluster  queues,  queue
          domains and queue instances which may be used to become
          the so called <I>master</I> <I>queue</I> of this parallel job. A more
          detailed  description  of <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> can be found in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  The <I>master</I> <I>queue</I> is defined as the queue
          where  the parallel job is started. The other queues to
          which the parallel job spawns tasks  are  called  <I>slave</I>
          <I>queues</I>.  A parallel job only has one <I>master</I> <I>queue</I>.

          This parameter has all the  properties  of  a  resource
          request  and  will  be merged with requirements derived
          from the -l option described above.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -notify
          Available for <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>  (with  command)  and  <I>qalter</I>
          only.

          This flag, when set causes Grid Engine to  send  "warn-
          ing" signals to a running job prior to sending the sig-
          nals themselves. If a SIGSTOP is pending, the job  will
          receive  a  SIGUSR1 several seconds before the SIGSTOP.
          If a SIGKILL is pending, the job will receive a SIGUSR2
          several seconds before the SIGKILL.  The amount of time
          delay is controlled by the  notify  parameter  in  each
          queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

          Note that the Linux operating system "misused" the user
          signals  SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 in some early Posix thread
          implementations. You might not want to use the  -notify
          option  if  you are running multi-threaded applications
          in your jobs under Linux, particularly on 2.0  or  ear-
          lier kernels.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -now y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qrsh</I>.

          -now y tries to start the job  immediately  or  not  at
          all.  The command returns 0 on success, or 1 on failure
          (also if the job could not be  scheduled  immediately).
          For  array  jobs submitted with the -now option, if all
          tasks cannot be immediately  scheduled,  no  tasks  are
          scheduled.  -now y is default for <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qrsh</I>
          With the -now n option, the job will be  put  into  the
          pending  queue  if  it  cannot be executed immediately.
          -now n is default for <I>qsub</I>.

     -N name
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          The name of the job. The name can be any printable  set
          of  characters  except "\n", "\t", "\r", "/", ":", "@",
          "\", "*", and "?", and it has to start with  an  alpha-
          betic character.
          If the -N option is not present,  Grid  Engine  assigns
          the  name of the job script to the job after any direc-
          tory pathname has been removed from the script-name. If
          the  script  is  read from standard input, the job name
          defaults to STDIN.
          In the case of <I>qsh</I> or <I>qlogin</I>  with  the  -N  option  is
          absent, the string `INTERACT' is assigned to the job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -noshell
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I> with a commandline.

          Do not start the commandline given to <I>qrsh</I> in a  user's
          login  shell,  i.e.   execute  it  without the wrapping
          shell.

          This option can be used to speed up execution  as  some
          overhead, like the shell startup and sourcing the shell
          resource files, is avoided.

          This option can only be used if no shell-specific  com-
          mandline  parsing  is required. If the commandline con-
          tains shell syntax like environment variable  substitu-
          tion  or  (back)  quoting, a shell must be started.  In
          this case, either do not use  the  -noshell  option  or
          include the shell call in the commandline.

          Example:
          qrsh echo '$HOSTNAME'
          Alternative call with the -noshell option
          qrsh -noshell /bin/tcsh -f -c 'echo $HOSTNAME'

     -nostdin
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I>.

          Suppress the input stream STDIN - <I>qrsh</I>  will  pass  the
          option  -n  to  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> command. This is especially
          useful, if multiple  tasks  are  executed  in  parallel
          using  <I>qrsh</I>,  e.g.  in  a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html">make(1)</A></B> process - it would be
          undefined, which process would get the input.

     -o [[hostname]:]path,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          The path used for the standard  output  stream  of  the
          job.  The path is handled as described in the -e option
          for the standard error stream.

          By default the file name for standard  output  has  the
          form  <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.o<I>job</I>_<I>id</I> and <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.o<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>.task_id for
          array job tasks (see -t option below).

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -ot override_tickets
          Available for <I>qalter</I> only.

          Changes the number of override tickets for  the  speci-
          fied job.  Requires manager/operator privileges.

     -P project_name
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Specifies the project to which this  job  is  assigned.
          The  administrator  needs to give permission to indivi-
          dual users to submit jobs to a specific  project.  (see
          -aprj option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>).

     -p priority
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the priority of the  job  relative
          to  other  jobs.   Priority  is an integer in the range
          -1023 to 1024.  The default priority value for jobs  is
          0.

          Users may only decrease the  priority  of  their  jobs.
          Grid   Engine  managers  and  administrators  may  also
          increase the priority associated with jobs. If a  pend-
          ing job has higher priority, it is earlier eligible for
          being dispatched by the Grid Engine scheduler.


     -pe parallel_environment n[-[m]]|[-]m,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Parallel programming environment (PE)  to  instantiate.
          The  range  descriptor behind the PE name specifies the
          number of parallel processes to  be  run.  Grid  Engine
          will  allocate  the appropriate resources as available.
          The <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B> manual page  contains  information  about
          the definition of PEs and about how to obtain a list of
          currently valid PEs.
          You can specify a PE name which uses the wildcard char-
          acter,  "*".   Thus  the  request "pvm*" will match any
          parallel environment with  a  name  starting  with  the
          string "pvm". In the case of multiple parallel environ-
          ments whose names match the name string,  the  parallel
          environment with the most available slots is chosen.
          The range specification is a list of range  expressions
          of the form "n-m", where n and m are positive, non-zero
          integers.  The form "n" is equivalent  to  "n-n".   The
          form  "-m"  is  equivalent  to "1-m".  The form "n-" is
          equivalent to "n-infinity".  The range specification is
          processed  as  follows:  The  largest  number of queues
          requested is checked first. If  enough  queues  meeting
          the  specified  attribute  list  are available, all are
          allocated. If not, the next smaller number of queues is
          checked, and so forth.
          If additional -l options are present, they restrict the
          set of eligible queues for the parallel job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -q wc_queue_list
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

          Defines or redefines a list of  cluster  queues,  queue
          domains or queue instances which may be used to execute
          this job. Please find a description of <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  This parameter has all the properties of
          a resource request and will be merged with requirements
          derived from the -l option described above.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -R y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

          Indicates whether a reservation for this job should  be
          done.  Reservation  is  never  done for immediate jobs,
          i.e. jobs submitted using the -now yes option.   Please
          note  that  regardless  of the reservation request, job
          reservation might be disabled using max_reservation  in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>  and  might  be limited only to a certain
          number of high priority jobs.

          By default jobs are submitted with the -R n option.

     -r y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Identifies the ability of a job to be rerun or not.  If
          the  value of -r is 'yes', the job will be rerun if the
          job was  aborted  without  leaving  a  consistent  exit
          state.   (This  is  typically  the  case if the node on
          which the job is running crashes).  If -r is 'no',  the
          job will not be rerun under any circumstances.
          Interactive jobs submitted with <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> or <I>qlogin</I> are
          not rerunable.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -sc variable[=value],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Sets the given name/value pairs as the  job's  context.
          Value  may  be  omitted. Grid Engine replaces the job's
          previously defined context with the one  given  as  the
          argument.   Multiple  -ac,  -dc, and -sc options may be
          given.  The order is important.
          Contexts provide a way to dynamically attach and remove
          meta-information  to  and from a job. The context vari-
          ables are not passed to the job's execution context  in
          its environment.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -shell y[es]|n[o]
          Available only for <I>qsub</I>.

          -shell  n  causes  qsub  to  execute  the   commandline
          directly,  as  if by <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/exec.html">exec(2)</A></B>.  No command shell will be
          executed for the job.  This option only applies when -b
          y is also used.  Without -b y, -shell n has no effect.

          This option can be used to speed up execution  as  some
          overhead, like the shell startup and sourcing the shell
          resource files is avoided.

          This option can only be used if no shell-specific  com-
          mandline  parsing  is required. If the commandline con-
          tains shell syntax, like environment variable substitu-
          tion  or  (back)  quoting, a shell must be started.  In
          this case either do not use the -shell n option or exe-
          cute  the shell as the commandline and pass the path to
          the executable as a parameter.

          If a job executed with the -shell n option fails due to
          a  user  error,  such as an invalid path to the execut-
          able, the job will enter the error state.

          -shell y cancels the effect of  a  previous  -shell  n.
          Otherwise, it has no effect.

          See -b and -noshell for more information.

     -soft
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Signifies that all resource requirements  following  in
          the  command  line will be soft requirements and are to
          be filled on an "as available" basis.
          As Grid Engine scans the command line and  script  file
          for  Grid  Engine  options  and parameters, it builds a
          list  of  resources  required  by  the  job.  All  such
          resource  requests  are considered as absolutely essen-
          tial for the job to commence. If the  -soft  option  is
          encountered   during   the   scan  then  all  following
          resources are designated  as  "soft  requirements"  for
          execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the
          -hard flag (see above) is encountered at a later  stage
          of  the  scan,  all resource requests following it once
          again become "essential". The -hard and  -soft  options
          in effect act as "toggles" during the scan.

     -sync y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I>.

          -sync y causes <I>qsub</I> to wait for  the  job  to  complete
          before  exiting.   If  the  job completes successfully,
          <I>qsub</I>'<I>s</I> exit code will be that of the completed job.  If
          the job fails to complete successfully, <I>qsub</I> will print
          out a error message indicating why the job  failed  and
          will  have  an exit code of 1.  If <I>qsub</I> is interrupted,
          e.g. with CTRL-C, before the  job  completes,  the  job
          will be canceled.
          With the -sync n option, <I>qsub</I> will exit  with  an  exit
          code of 0 as soon as the job is submitted successfully.
          -sync n is default for <I>qsub</I>.
          If -sync y is used in conjunction  with  -now  y,  <I>qsub</I>
          will  behave as though only -now y were given until the
          job has been successfully scheduled, after  which  time
          <I>qsub</I> will behave as though only -sync y were given.

     -S [[hostname]:]pathname,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

          Specifies the interpreting shell for the job. Only  one
          pathname  component  without  a host specifier is valid
          and only one path name for a  given  host  is  allowed.
          Shell paths with host assignments define the interpret-
          ing shell for the job if  the  host  is  the  execution
          host. The shell path without host specification is used
          if the execution host matches none of the hosts in  the
          list.

          Furthermore,  the  pathname  can  be  constructed  with
          pseudo  environment  variables  as described for the -e
          option above.

          In the case of <I>qsh</I> the specified shell path is used  to
          execute  the  corresponding  command interpreter in the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> (via its -<I>e</I> option) started on behalf  of  the
          interactive job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -t n[-m[:s]]
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Submits a so called <I>Array</I> <I>Job</I>, i.e. an array of identi-
          cal  tasks being differentiated only by an index number
          and being treated by Grid Engine almost like  a  series
          of jobs. The option argument to -t specifies the number
          of array job tasks and the index number which  will  be
          associated  with  the  tasks. The index numbers will be
          exported to the job tasks via the environment  variable
          SGE_TASK_ID.  The  option  arguments n, m and s will be
          available    through    the    environment    variables
          SGE_TASK_FIRST, SGE_TASK_LAST and  SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE.

          Following restrictions apply to the values n and m:

               1 &lt;= n &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
               1 &lt;= m &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
               n &lt;= m

          <I>max</I>_<I>aj</I>_<I>tasks</I> is defined in  the  cluster  configuration
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)

          The task id range specified in the option argument  may
          be a single number, a simple range of the form n-m or a
          range with a step size. Hence, the task id range speci-
          fied  by  2-10:2 would result in the task id indexes 2,
          4, 6, 8, and 10, for a total of 5 identical tasks, each
          with  the  environment  variable SGE_TASK_ID containing
          one of the 5 index numbers.

          All array job tasks inherit the same resource  requests
          and  attribute  definitions as specified in the <I>qsub</I> or
          <I>qalter</I> command line, except  for  the  -t  option.  The
          tasks  are scheduled independently and, provided enough
          resources exist, concurrently, very much like  separate
          jobs.   However,  an  array job or a sub-array there of
          can be accessed as  a  single  unit  by  commands  like
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.  See the corresponding manual pages
          for further detail.

          Array jobs are commonly used to execute the  same  type
          of operation on varying input data sets correlated with
          the task index number. The number of tasks in  a  array
          job is unlimited.

          STDOUT and STDERR of array job tasks  will  be  written
          into different files with the default location
          &lt;jobname&gt;.['e'|'o']&lt;job_id&gt;'.'&lt;task_id&gt;

          In order to change this default, the -e and -o  options
          (see  above)  can  be  used  together  with  the pseudo
          environment variables $HOME, $USER, $JOB_ID, $JOB_NAME,
          $HOSTNAME, and $SGE_TASK_ID.

          Note, that you can use the output redirection to divert
          the  output  of  all  tasks into the same file, but the
          result of this is undefined.


     -u username,...
          Available for <I>qalter</I> only. Changes  are  only  made  on
          those  jobs  which were submitted by users specified in
          the list of usernames.  For managers it is possible  to
          use the qalter -u '*' command to modify all jobs of all
          users.

          If you use the -u switch it is not permitted to specify
          an additional <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>range</I>_<I>list</I>.

     -v variable[=value],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qalter</I> and <I>qresub</I>.

          Defines or redefines the environment  variables  to  be
          exported  to  the execution context of the job.  If the
          -v option is present Grid Engine will add the  environ-
          ment  variables defined as arguments to the switch and,
          optionally, values of specified variables, to the  exe-
          cution context of the job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -verbose
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>.

          Unlike <I>qsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I>, <I>qrsh</I> does not output any  infor-
          mational  messages while establishing the session, com-
          pliant with the standard <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B>  and  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B>  system
          calls.   If  the  option  -verbose is set, <I>qrsh</I> behaves
          like the <I>qsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I> commands, outputing information
          about  the  process  of establishing the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> or <I>rlo-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/gin.html">gin(1)</A></B> session.

     -verify
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          Instead  of   submitting   a   job,   prints   detailed
          information  about  the would-be job as though <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>
          -j were used, including  the  effects  of  command-line
          parameters and the external environment.

     -V   Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qalter</I> and <I>qresub</I>.

          Specifies that all environment variables active  within
          the <I>qsub</I> utility be exported to the context of the job.

     -w e|w|n|v
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          Specifies a validation level applied to the job  to  be
          submitted  (<I>qsub</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  and  <I>qsh</I>)  or the specified
          queued job (<I>qalter</I>).  The information  displayed  indi-
          cates  whether the job can possibly be scheduled assum-
          ing an  empty  system  with  no  other  jobs.  Resource
          requests exceeding the configured maximal thresholds or
          requesting unavailable resource attributes are possible
          causes for jobs to fail this validation.

          The specifiers e, w, n and v define the following vali-
          dation modes:

          `e'  error - jobs with invalid requests will be
               rejected; the default for <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>
               and <I>qlogin</I>.
          `w'  warning - only a warning will be displayed
               for invalid requests.
          `n'  none - switches off validation; the default for
               <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I>.
          `v'  verify - does not submit the job but prints an
               extensive validation report.

          Note, that the necessary checks are performance consum-
          ing and hence the checking is switched off by default.

          Note also, that the reasons for job requirements  being
          invalid with respect to resource availability of queues
          are displayed in the "-w v" case using  the  format  as
          described  for  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> -F option (see description
          of  Full  Format  in  section  OUTPUT  FORMATS  of  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> manual page.

     command
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qrsh</I> only.

          The job's scriptfile or binary.  If not present  or  if
          the  operand  is  the single-character string '-', <I>qsub</I>
          reads the script from standard input.

     command_args
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Arguments to the  job.  Not  valid  if  the  script  is
          entered from standard input.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     xterm_args
          Available for <I>qsh</I> only.

          Arguments to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> executable, as defined in the
          configuration.  For details, refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Grid Engine cell <I>qsub</I>,
                    <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> or <I>qalter</I> use (in  the  order  of
                    precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

     DISPLAY        For <I>qsh</I> jobs the DISPLAY has to be  specified
                    at job submission.  If the DISPLAY is not set
                    by using the -display or the -v  switch,  the
                    contents  of the DISPLAY environment variable
                    are used as default.

     In addition to those environment variables specified  to  be
     exported  to the job via the -v or the -V option (see above)
     <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> add the following variables  with  the
     indicated values to the variable list:


     SGE_O_HOME     the home directory of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_HOST     the name of the host on which the  submitting
                    client is running.

     SGE_O_LOGNAME  the LOGNAME of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_MAIL     the MAIL of the submitting  client.  This  is
                    the mail directory of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_PATH     the executable search path of the  submitting
                    client.

     SGE_O_SHELL    the SHELL of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_TZ       the time zone of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_WORKDIR  the absolute  path  of  the  current  working
                    directory of the submitting client.

     Furthermore, Grid Engine sets additional variables into  the
     job's environment, as listed below.

     ARC

     SGE_ARCH       The Grid Engine architecture name of the node
                    on  which  the  job  is  running. The name is
                    compiled-in into the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> binary.

     SGE_CKPT_ENV   Specifies the checkpointing  environment  (as
                    selected with the -ckpt option) under which a
                    checkpointing  job  executes.  Only  set  for
                    checkpointing jobs.

     SGE_CKPT_DIR   Only set  for  checkpointing  jobs.  Contains
                    path  <I>ckpt</I>_<I>dir</I>  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>  ) of the
                    checkpoint interface.

     SGE_STDERR_PATH
                    the pathname of the file to which  the  stan-
                    dard  error  stream  of  the job is diverted.
                    Commonly used for enhancing the  output  with
                    error  messages from prolog, epilog, parallel
                    environment   start/stop   or   checkpointing
                    scripts.

     SGE_STDOUT_PATH
                    the pathname of the file to which  the  stan-
                    dard  output  stream  of the job is diverted.
                    Commonly used for enhancing the  output  with
                    messages   from   prolog,   epilog,  parallel
                    environment   start/stop   or   checkpointing
                    scripts.

     SGE_STDIN_PATH the pathname of the file from which the stan-
                    dard  input  stream of the job is taken. This
                    variable might be used  in  combination  with
                    SGE_O_HOST   in   prolog/epilog   scripts  to
                    transfer the input file from  the  submit  to
                    the execution host.

     SGE_JOB_SPOOL_DIR
                    The  directory  used  by  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  to
                    store  job related data during job execution.
                    This directory is owned by root or by a  Grid
                    Engine administrative account and commonly is
                    not open for read or write access to  regular
                    users.

     SGE_TASK_ID    The index number of  the  current  array  job
                    task (see -t option above). This is an unique
                    number in each array job and can be  used  to
                    reference  different  input data records, for
                    example. This environment variable is set  to
                    "undefined"  for non-array jobs. It is possi-
                    ble to change the predefined  value  of  this
                    variable with -v or -V (see options above).

     SGE_TASK_FIRST The index number of the first array job  task
                    (see  -t  option  above).  It  is possible to
                    change the predefined value of this  variable
                    with -v or -V (see options above).

     SGE_TASK_LAST  The index number of the last array  job  task
                    (see  -t  option  above).  It  is possible to
                    change the predefined value of this  variable
                    with -v or -V (see options above).

     SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE
                    The stepsize of the array  job  specification
                    (see  -t  option  above).  It  is possible to
                    change the predefined value of this  variable
                    with -v or -V (see options above).

     ENVIRONMENT    The ENVIRONMENT variable is set to  BATCH  to
                    identify that the job is being executed under
                    Grid Engine control.

     HOME           The  user's  home  directory  path  from  the

                    running.

     JOB_ID         A   unique   identifier   assigned   by   the
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>  when  the  job was submitted.
                    The job ID is a decimal integer in the  range
                    1 to 99999.

     JOB_NAME       The job name. For batch jobs or jobs  submit-
                    ted  by  <I>qrsh</I> with a command, the job name is
                    built as basename of the <I>qsub</I> script filename
                    resp. the <I>qrsh</I> command.  For interactive jobs
                    it is set  to  `INTERACTIVE'  for  <I>qsh</I>  jobs,
                    `QLOGIN'  for  <I>qlogin</I>  jobs and `QRLOGIN' for
                    <I>qrsh</I> jobs without a command.

     PE_HOSTFILE    The path of a file containing the  definition
                    of the virtual parallel machine assigned to a
                    parallel job by Grid Engine. See the descrip-
                    tion   of   the   $pe_hostfile  parameter  in
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B> for details on the format  of  this

                    available for parallel jobs.

     QUEUE          The name of the cluster queue  in  which  the
                    job is running.

     REQUEST        Available for batch jobs only.

                    The request name of a job as  specified  with
                    the  -N  switch  (see  above) or taken as the
                    name of the job script file.

     RESTARTED      This variable is set to 1 if a job  was  res-
                    tarted either after a system crash or after a
                    migration in case of a checkpointing job. The

                    in use for the job.

     TMPDIR         The absolute  path  to  the  job's  temporary
                    working directory.

     TMP            The same as TMPDIR; provided for  compatibil-
                    ity with NQS.

     TZ             The  time   zone   variable   imported   from

RESTRICTIONS
     There is no controlling terminal for batch jobs  under  Grid
     Engine,  and  any tests or actions on a controlling terminal
     will fail. If these operations are in your .login or  .cshrc
     file, they may cause your job to abort.

     Insert the following test before any commands that  are  not
     pertinent to batch jobs in your .login:

          if ( $?JOB_NAME) then
               echo "Grid Engine spooled job"
               exit 0
          endif

     Don't forget to set your shell's search path in  your  shell
     start-up before this code.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0    Operation was executed successfully.

     25   It was not possible to register a new job according  to
          the configured <I>max</I>_<I>u</I>_<I>jobs</I> or <I>max</I>_<I>jobs</I> limit. Additional
          information may be found in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>

     &gt;0   Error occured.

EXAMPLES
     The following is the simplest form of a Grid  Engine  script
     file.

     =====================================================


     #!/bin/csh
        a.out


     =====================================================

     The next example is a more complex Grid Engine script.

     =====================================================

     #!/bin/csh

     # Which account to be charged cpu time
     #$ -A santa_claus

     # date-time to run, format [[CC]yy]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
     #$ -a 12241200

     # to run I want 6 or more parallel processes
     # under the PE pvm. the processes require
     # 128M of memory
     #$ -pe pvm 6- -l mem=128

     # If I run on dec_x put stderr in /tmp/foo, if I
     # run on sun_y, put stderr in /usr/me/foo
     #$ -e dec_x:/tmp/foo,sun_y:/usr/me/foo

     # Send mail to these users
     #$ -M santa@nothpole,claus@northpole

     # Mail at beginning/end/on suspension
     #$ -m bes

     # Export these environmental variables
     #$ -v PVM_ROOT,FOOBAR=BAR

     # The job is located in the current
     # working directory.
     #$ -cwd
