<p>
As a Project Owner with one or more development projects 
hosted on this site, your administrative tasks are organized around the same 
project pages viewed by other project members or registered users. You access 
these same project pages as any project member or registered user, 
however,&nbsp;your page view may include additional administrative links and 
options.&nbsp; Your Project Resources toolbar also includes an additional 
<i>Admin </i>     link enabling you to edit your project home page and appearance throughout the site.
<p>
              If your project's approval is pending, you still have access to most features and tools to help you get established and set up. Because the hosted tools for projects are automatically configured upon project creation, you may:
<ul>
<li>invite additional developer participants
<li>update your project's home page
<li>publish project news
<li>upload project files and documents
<li>post to your project's mailing lists
<li>create subdirectories in your project's CVS repository
<li>check in source code
<li>use the issue tracker to enter and search project 
  issues.</li>          
</ul>
<p>While still in a pending approval status you cannot perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul><p><li>add project members
<li>approve project membership requests
  <li>grant project roles. </li>     
  </ul>
<p></p>

The help documents in this section cover this site's administrative functions available to you as a Project Owner. How you use this functionality to structure and lead your project toward achieving particular goals remains largely in your purview. Whenever possible, these help documents suggest the implications of administrative options with respect to project leadership and management.
<p>
Project type will strongly influence the method in which you manage projects.&nbsp; If your project is a proprietary endeavor with commercial licensing, project  governance may be largely determined by external factors, for example: corporate strategy, fiscal priorities, organizational structure, and established development methods. While many collaborative development practices can be successfully adopted within this framework, final decision making authority rests with the license holder and influences the development schedule and project goals to a high degree.
<p>
If your project is under open source licensing, the development culture is intrinsically different and far more self determinant. The Project owner -- equipped with some knowledge and understanding of open source practices -- is responsible for&nbsp;establishing and communicating&nbsp;the project's parameters up front. As the project progresses, the project owner will need to&nbsp;nurture project participants toward an increasing sense of community and ownership.
<p>
A third possibility is a combination of the above, that is, you are leading an open source project with the involvement and support of a corporate entity embracing open source to achieve certain business goals. In these circumstances, as the project owner you essentially function as the liaison between two cultures.
<p>
Whichever scenario applies,&nbsp;answering&nbsp;the 
questions below will help you to communicate&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundamental purpose and structure of the project to members and potential participants. While these questions are geared towards open source projects,&nbsp;most can be applied&nbsp;to collaborative and proprietary projects as well. Consider the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>What is the ultimate mission of the project?
<p></p>
<li>What decision making and conflict resolution methodology&nbsp;will be used for the project(for example, voting, consensus building, or final authority)?&nbsp;
<p></p>
<li>What coding standards will be used&nbsp; for the project (for example, adherence to certain conventions and/or emphasis on particular architectural characteristics)?
<p></p>
<li>What methods will be used to help project 
  members&nbsp;gain&nbsp;responsibility and&nbsp;ownership within the project (for example, how can developers' roles evolve to earn more privileges such as becoming module leaders)?
<p></p>
<li>What are the terms for accepting contributions (for 
  example, as defined by the licensing, but also how are non-member ideas or 
  bug-fixes dealt with)?</li>                       
</ul>
