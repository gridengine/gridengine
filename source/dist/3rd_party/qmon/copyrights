TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION
OF THE SPINBOX WIDGET
This widget is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
There is NO WARRANTY for this widget.
BECAUSE THE WIDGET IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
WIDGET, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
WIDGET "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THIS WIDGET IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE WIDGET PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OF THE WIDGET (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE IN THE WIDGET TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH 
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
widget or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the widget (or any work based on the widget), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the widget or works based on it.

You may use this widget in your own works. You may also modify this
widget to create a work of your own. In either case, you must meet all
the following conditions:

Each copy of the work must be accompanied with a complete and
unmodified copy of the distribution of the widget that the work
uses or is based on (This widget's distribution is called
spinbox[version].tar, where [version] is whatever version
the work uses).  This must be included in the work's distribution
at no charge.  Even works that incorporate a modified version of
this widget must include this complete and unmodified copy
of the original spinbox distribution because the modified version
of the widget must meet these conditions.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work
that the widget is used in it (or that the work is based on the
widget, or that the work uses a widget based upon this widget)
and that the widget's use is covered by this license.
If the work during execution displays copyright notices,
you must include the copyright notice for the widget among them,
as well as a reference directing the user to the complete and
unmodified copy of the distribution that accompanies the work.

If you have access to internet e-mail, you must make a good faith
effort to notify the author of the widget describing the use
to which the widget is being put.  The author's email address can be
found in the widget's documentation.  Nothing will be done with
this information; this condition exists only to satisfy the author's
curiosity regarding the usefulness of this widget. :)

No other conditions need be met for the use of this widget in other works.</i>

Works that use this widget or that are based on this widget may follow whatever
licensing scheme they please provided that the previous conditions are met.
These conditions are intended to:

encourage wide distribution of this widget by including ``spinbox[version].tar'' with:
every work that uses this widget
every new work based upon this widget
and every work that uses a work based upon this widget.

prominently display the copyright and lack of warranty of this spinbox widget in
every distribution that includes the ``spinbox[version].tar'' file.

remove restrictions of the previous license (GNU) that might keep developers
of commercial software from using the widget; specifically, the propagation of the GPL
to any work that uses this widget and the obligation to provide the ability to relink
any work that uses this widget.

satisfy the author's curiosity whether or not this widget is of any use and
whether or not he should release more widgets.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the widget's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and
distribute a copy of this license along with the widget.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of this
widget, provided that this does not conflict with the requirement that
works using either this widget or works based on this widget must provide
a free copy of the original widget.
In addition, you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.

The most recent version of this widget should be available from
