NAME
     queue_conf - Grid Engine queue configuration file format

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Queue</I>_<I>conf</I> reflects the format of the template file for  the
     cluster queue configuration.  Via the -aq and -mq options of
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> command, you can add cluster queues and  modify
     the configuration of any queue in the cluster.

     The <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I> parameters take as  values  strings,  integer
     decimal  numbers  or  boolean, time and memory specifiers as
     well as comma separated lists. A time specifier either  con-
     sists  of  a  positive decimal, hexadecimal or octal integer
     constant, in which case the value is interpreted  to  be  in
     seconds,  or is built by 3 decimal integer numbers separated
     by colon signs where the first number counts the hours,  the
     second  the  minutes  and the third the seconds. If a number
     would be zero it can be left out but  the  separating  colon
     must remain (e.g. 1:0:1 = 1::1 means 1 hours and 1 second).

     Memory specifiers are positive decimal, hexadecimal or octal
     integer  constants  which  may  be  followed by a multiplier
     letter. Valid multiplier letters are k, K, m and M, where  k
     means multiply the value by 1000, K multiply by 1024, m mul-
     tiply by 1000*1000 and M multiplies by 1024*1024. If no mul-
     tiplier is present, the value is just counted in bytes.

     If more than one host  is  specified  under  'hostlist'  (by
     means  of  a  list  of  hosts or with host groups) it can be
     desirable to specify divergences from the setting  used  for
     each  host.  These  divergences  can  be expressed using the
     enhanced <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I> specifier syntax.   This  syntax  builds
     upon  the  regular  parameter  specifier syntax as described
     below under 'FORMAT' separately for each  parameter  and  in
     the paragraph above:

     "["host_identifier=&lt;parameters_specifier_syntax&gt;"]"
     [,"["host_identifier=&lt;parameters_specifier_syntax&gt;"]" ]

     Even in the enhanced <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I> specifier syntax an entry

     &lt;current_attribute_syntax&gt;

     without brackets denoting the default  setting  is  required
     and  used  for  all queue instances where no divergences are
     specified.  Tuples with a host group  host_identifier  over-
     ride   the   default   setting.  Tuples  with  a  host  name
     host_identifier override both the default and the host group
     setting. Note that also with the enhanced <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I> specif-
     ier syntax a default setting is always needed for all confi-
     guration attributes.

     Integrity verifications will be applied  on  the  configura-
     tion.

     Configurations without default setting are rejected.   Ambi-
     gous configurations with more than one attribute setting for
     a particular host are rejected.   Configurations  containing
     override  values for hosts not enlisted under 'hostname' are
     accepted but are indicated by -sick of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> The  cluster
     queue  should  contain a non-ambigous specification for each
     configuration attribute of  each  queue  instance  specified
     under  hostname  in <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I>. Ambigous configurations with
     more than one attribute setting resulting  from  overlapping
     host  groups  are  indicated  by  -explain c of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> and
     cause the queue instance  with  ambigous  configurations  to
     enter the c(onfiguration ambibous) state.

FORMAT
     The following list of <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I>  parameters  specifies  the
     <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I> content:

  qname
     The name of the cluster queue(type string; template default:
     template).

  hostlist
     A list of host names (fully-qualified) and host group names.
     Host  group  names  must begin with an "@" sign. If multiple
     hosts are  specified  the  <I>queue</I>_<I>conf</I>  constitutes  multiple
     queue  instances.  Each  host  may be specified only once in
     this list. (type string; template default: NONE).

  seq_no
     In conjunction with the hosts load situation at a time  this
     parameter  specifies this queue's position in the scheduling
     order within the suitable queues for a job to be  dispatched
     under    consideration   of   the   queue_sort_method   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> ).

     Regardless  of  the  queue_sort_method   setting,   <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>
     reports  queue information in the order defined by the value
     of  the  seq_no.  Set  this  parameter  to  a  monotonically
     increasing sequence. (type number; template default: 0).

  load_thresholds
     load_thresholds is a list of load thresholds. Already if one
     of  the  thresholds  is  exceeded  no  further  jobs will be
     scheduled to the queues and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> will signal an  overload
     condition for this node. Arbitrary load values being defined
     in the "host" and "global"  complexes  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>  for
     details) can be used.


     The syntax is that of a comma separated list with each  list
     element  consisting  of  the  name of a load value, an equal
     sign and the threshold value being intended to  trigger  the
     overload situation (e.g. load_avg=1.75,users_logged_in=5).

     Note: Load values as well as  consumable  resources  may  be
     scaled  differently  for different hosts if specified in the
     corresponding   execution   host   definitions   (refer   to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> for more information). Load thresholds are com-
     pared against the scaled load and consumable values.

  suspend_thresholds
     A list of load thresholds with the same semantics as that of
     the   load_thresholds  parameter  (see  above)  except  that
     exceeding one of the denoted thresholds initiates suspension
     of  one  of  multiple  jobs  in the queue.  See the nsuspend
     parameter below for details on the number of jobs which  are
     suspended.

  nsuspend
     The number of jobs  which  are  suspended/enabled  per  time
     interval  if  at  least  one  of  the load thresholds in the
     suspend_thresholds   list   is    exceeded    or    if    no
     suspend_threshold    is   violated   anymore   respectively.
     Nsuspend jobs are suspended in each time interval  until  no
     suspend_thresholds  are  exceeded anymore or all jobs in the
     queue are suspended. Jobs are enabled in  the  corresponding
     way  if  the suspend_thresholds are no longer exceeded.  The
     time interval in which the suspensions of the jobs occur  is
     defined in suspend_interval below.

  suspend_interval
     The  time  interval  in  which  further  nsuspend  jobs  are
     suspended  if  one  of the suspend_thresholds (see above for
     both) is exceeded by the current load on the host  on  which
     the  queue  is located.  The time interval is also used when
     enabling the jobs.

  priority
     The priority parameter specifies the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html">nice(2)</A></B> value at  which
     jobs  in  this queue will be run. The type is number and the
     default is zero (which means no nice  value  is  set  expli-
     citly).  Negative  values (up to -20) correspond to a higher
     scheduling priority, positive values (up to +20)  correspond
     to a lower scheduling priority.

     The value of priority has  no  effect  because  SGE  adjusts
     priorities dynamically to implement the SGE entitlement pol-
     icy goals. Dynamic priority adjustment can be switched  off,
     by  setting  the reprioritize_interval to 00:00:00, which is
     the default value. In this case,  the  setting  of  priority
     also will haven't an effect.

  min_cpu_interval
     The time between two automatic checkpoints in case of  tran-
     sparently  checkpointing  jobs.  The  maximum  of  the  time
     requested by the user via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the  time  defined  by
     the  queue  configuration  is  used  as checkpoint interval.
     Since checkpoint files may be considerably  large  and  thus
     writing  them to the file system may become expensive, users
     and administrators are advised to choose sufficiently  large
     time  intervals.  min_cpu_interval  is  of type time and the
     default is 5 minutes (which usually  is  suitable  for  test
     purposes only).

  processors
     A set of processors in case of  a  multiprocessor  execution
     host  can  be  defined  to  which the jobs executing in this
     queue are bound. The value type of this parameter is a range
     description  like that of the -pe option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> (e.g. 1-
     4,8,10) denoting the processor  numbers  for  the  processor
     group  to  be  used.  Obviously  the interpretation of these
     values relies on operating system specifics and is thus per-
     formed inside <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> running on the queue host. There-
     fore, the parsing of the parameter has to be provided by the
     execution  daemon  and  the parameter is only passed through
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> as a string.

     Currently, support is only provided for  SGI  multiprocessor
     machines  running  IRIX  6.2 and Digital UNIX multiprocessor
     machines. In the case of Digital UNIX only one job per  pro-
     cessor  set  is  allowed  to  execute at the same time, i.e.
     slots (see above) should be set to 1 for this queue.

  qtype
     The type of queue. Currently <I>batch</I>, <I>interactive</I> or a  combi-
     nation in a comma separated list or <I>NONE</I>.

     The formerly supported types parallel and checkpointing  are
     not  allowed anymore. A queue instance is impicitely of type
     parallel/checkpointing if there is a parallel environment or
     a  checkpointing interface specified for this queue instance
     in pe_list/ckpt_list. Formerly possible settings e.g.

     qtype   PARALLEL

     could be transfered into

     qtype   NONE
     pe_list pe_name

     (type string; default: batch interactive).

  pe_list
     The list of administartor defined parallel  environments  to
     be associated with the queue. The default is <I>NONE</I>.

  ckpt_list
     The list of administartor defined  checkpointing  interfaces
     to be associated with the queue. The default is <I>NONE</I>.

  rerun
     Defines a default behavior for jobs  which  are  aborted  by
     system crashes or manual "violent" (via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) shutdown of
     the   complete   Grid   Engine   system    (including    the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  of the jobs and their process hierarchy) on
     the queue host. As soon as  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  is  restarted  and
     detects  that a job has been aborted for such reasons it can
     be restarted if the jobs are restartable. A job may  not  be
     restartable,  for  example,  if  it updates databases (first
     reads then writes to the same  record  of  a  database/file)
     because  the  abortion of the job may have left the database
     in an inconsistent state. If the owner of  a  job  wants  to
     overrule  the default behavior for the jobs in the queue the
     -r option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> can be used.

     The type of this parameter is boolean, thus either  TRUE  or
     FALSE  can  be  specified. The default is FALSE, i.e. do not
     restart jobs automatically.

  slots
     The maximum number of concurrently executing jobs allowed in
     the queue.  Type is number.

  tmpdir
     The tmpdir parameter specifies the absolute path to the base
     of  the  temporary  directory  filesystem. When <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     launches a job, it creates  a  uniquely-named  directory  in
     this  filesystem  for  the  purpose of holding scratch files
     during job execution. At job completion, this directory  and
     its  contents  are  removed  automatically.  The environment
     variables TMPDIR and TMP are set to the path  of  each  jobs
     scratch directory (type string; default: /tmp).

  shell
     If either <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> or <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> is  specified
     as  the  shell_start_mode parameter in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> the shell
     parameter specifies  the  executable  path  of  the  command
     interpreter  (e.g.   <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B>  or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>) to be used to process
     the job scripts executed in the  queue.  The  definition  of
     shell  can  be overruled by the job owner via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -S
     option.

     The  type  of  the  parameter  is  string.  The  default  is
     /bin/csh.


  shell_start_mode
     This parameter defines the  mechanisms  which  are  used  to
     actually  invoke the job scripts on the execution hosts. The
     following values are recognized:

     <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>
          If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interac-
          tively  by  invoking  it  just with the script name the
          operating system's executable loader uses the  informa-
          tion  provided in a comment such as `#!/bin/csh' in the
          first line of the script to detect which command inter-
          preter to start to interpret the script. This mechanism
          is  used  by  Grid  Engine  when   starting   jobs   if
          <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I> is defined as shell_start_mode.

     <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>
          POSIX does not consider first script line comments such
          a `#!/bin/csh' as being significant. The POSIX standard
          for batch queuing systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires
          a  compliant queuing system to ignore such lines but to
          use user specified or configured default command inter-
          preters  instead.  Thus,  if shell_start_mode is set to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> Grid Engine will either use the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see above).

     <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>
          Setting  the  shell_start_mode  parameter   either   to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  or  <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>  requires you to set
          the umask in use for <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every  user
          has  read  access  to  the active_jobs directory in the
          spool directory of the corresponding execution  daemon.
          In  case you have prolog and epilog scripts configured,
          they also need to be readable by any user who may  exe-
          cute jobs.
          If this violates your site's security policies you  may
          want to set shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>. This
          will force Grid Engine to open the job script  as  well
          as  the  epilogue and prologue scripts for reading into
          STDIN as root (if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  was  started  as  root)
          before  changing  to the job owner's user account.  The
          script is then fed into the STDIN stream of the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see above).
          Thus setting shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> also
          implies  <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  behavior. Note, however, that
          feeding scripts into the  STDIN  stream  of  a  command
          interpreter  may  cause trouble if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B>
          are invoked inside a job script as  they  also  process
          the  STDIN  stream  of  the  command interpreter. These
          problems can usually be  resolved  by  redirecting  the
          STDIN  channel of those commands to come from /dev/null
          (e.g. rsh host date &lt; /dev/null). Note also,  that  any
          command-line options associated with the job are passed
          to the executing shell. The  shell  will  only  forward
          them  to  the  job  if they are not recognized as valid
          shell options.

     The default for shell_start_mode is <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.

  prolog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started before
     execution of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment set-
     ting as that for the Grid Engine jobs to be  started  after-
     wards.  An  optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
     which this procedure is to be started. The procedures  stan-
     dard  output  and the error output stream are written to the
     same file used also for the standard output and error output
     of  each job.  This procedure is intended as a means for the
     Grid Engine administrator to automate the execution of  gen-
     eral  site  specific tasks like the preparation of temporary
     file systems with the need for the same context  information
     as  the job. This queue configuration entry overwrites clus-
     ter global or execution  host  specific  prolog  definitions
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

     The default for prolog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents  from execution of a prologue script.  The  special
     variables for constituting a command line are the same  like
     in  prolog  definitions  of  the  cluster configuration (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

  epilog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started  after
     execution of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment set-
     ting as that for the Grid Engine jobs  that  has  just  com-
     pleted.  An optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
     which this procedure is to be started. The procedures  stan-
     dard  output  and the error output stream are written to the
     same file used also for the standard output and error output
     of  each  job. This procedure is intended as a means for the
     Grid Engine administrator to automate the execution of  gen-
     eral  site  specific tasks like the cleaning up of temporary
     file systems with the need for the same context  information
     as  the job. This queue configuration entry overwrites clus-
     ter global or execution  host  specific  epilog  definitions
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

     The default for epilog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents  from execution of a epilogue script.  The  special
     variables for constituting a command line are the same  like
     in  prolog  definitions  of  the  cluster configuration (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).


  starter_method
     The specified executable path will be used as a job  starter
     facility  responsible  for starting batch jobs.  The execut-
     able path will be executed instead of the  configured  shell
     to  start the job. The job arguments will be passed as argu-
     ments to the job starter. The  following  environment  vari-
     ables  are  used to pass information to the job starter con-
     cerning  the  shell  environment  which  was  configured  or
     requested to start the job.


     <I>SGE</I>_<I>STARTER</I>_<I>SHELL</I>_<I>PATH</I>
          The name of the requested shell to start the job

     <I>SGE</I>_<I>STARTER</I>_<I>SHELL</I>_<I>START</I>_<I>MODE</I>
          The configured shell_start_mode

     <I>SGE</I>_<I>STARTER</I>_<I>USE</I>_<I>LOGIN</I>_<I>SHELL</I>
          Set to "true" if the shell is supposed to be used as  a
          login shell (see login_shells in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)

     The starter_method will not be invoked for  qsh,  qlogin  or
     qrsh acting as rlogin.


  suspend_method
  resume_method
  terminate_method
     These parameters can be used  for  overwriting  the  default
     method  used  by  Grid  Engine  for suspension, release of a
     suspension and for termination of a job.  Per  default,  the
     signals  SIGSTOP,  SIGCONT  and SIGKILL are delivered to the
     job to perform these actions. However, for some applications
     this is not appropriate.

     If no executable path is given, Grid Engine takes the speci-
     fied parameter entries as the signal to be delivered instead
     of the default signal. A signal must be  either  a  positive
     number  or a signal name with "SIG" as prefix and the signal
     name as printed by <I>kill</I> -<I>l</I> (e.g.  SIGTERM).

     If an executable path is given (it must be an <I>absolute</I>  <I>path</I>
     starting  with  a  "/")  then this command together with its
     arguments is started by Grid Engine to perform the appropri-
     ate  action. The following special variables are expanded at
     runtime and can be used (besides  any  other  strings  which
     have  to  be  interpreted by the procedures) to constitute a
     command line:

     $<I>host</I>
          The name of the host on which the procedure is started.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>owner</I>
          The user name of the job owner.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>
          Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>name</I>
          The name of the job.

     $<I>queue</I>
          The name of the queue.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>pid</I>
          The pid of the job.


  notify
     The time waited between delivery of SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2  notifi-
     cation signals and suspend/kill signals if job was submitted
     with the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -<I>notify</I> option.

  owner_list
     The owner_list names the login names (in a  comma  separated
     list)  of  those  users  who  are authorized to suspend this
     queue (Grid Engine operators and managers can suspend queues
     by default). It is customary to set this field for queues on
     interactive workstations where the computing  resources  are
     shared  between  interactive  sessions and Grid Engine jobs,
     allowing the workstation owner to have priority access (type
     string; default: NONE).

  user_lists
     The user_lists parameter contains a comma separated list  of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists  has  access to the queue. If the user_lists parameter
     is set to NONE (the default) any user has access  being  not
     explicitly  excluded via the xuser_lists parameter described
     below.  If a user  is  contained  both  in  an  access  list
     enlisted  in  xuser_lists  and user_lists the user is denied
     access to the queue.

  xuser_lists
     The xuser_lists parameter contains a comma separated list of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists is not allowed to access the queue. If the xuser_lists
     parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has  access.
     If  a  user  is contained both in an access list enlisted in
     xuser_lists and user_lists the user is denied access to  the
     queue.

  projects
     The projects parameter contains a comma  separated  list  of
     projects  that have access to the queue. Any projects not in
     this list are denied access to the queue.  If  set  to  NONE
     (the  default),  any project has access that is not specifi-
     cally excluded via the xprojects parameter described  below.
     If  a  project is in both the projects and xprojects parame-
     ters, the project is denied access to the queue.

  xprojects
     The xprojects parameter contains a comma separated  list  of
     projects that are denied access to the queue. If set to NONE
     (the default), no projects  are  denied  access  other  than
     those   denied   access  based  on  the  projects  parameter
     described above.  If a project is in both the  projects  and
     xprojects  parameters,  the  project is denied access to the
     queue.

  subordinate_list
     A list of Grid Engine cluster queues. Relashionship  however
     are  in  effect only between queue instances residing at the
     same host. If there is a queue instance (be in the  sub-  or
     superordinated  one)  on only one particular host this rela-
     tionship is ignored.  queue instances residing on  the  same
     host  will  be  suspended  when a specified count of jobs is
     running in this queue instance.  The list  specification  is
     the  same  as  that  of the load_thresholds parameter above,
     e.g. low_pri_q=5,small_q. The numbers denote the  job  slots
     of  the  queue that have to be filled to trigger the suspen-
     sion of the subordinated queue. If no value  is  assigned  a
     suspension  is  triggered  if  all  slots  of  the queue are
     filled.

     On nodes which host more than one queue, you might  wish  to
     accord  better  service  to  certain  classes of jobs (e.g.,
     queues that are dedicated to parallel processing might  need
     priority  over  low  priority  production  queues;  default:
     NONE).

  complex_values
     complex_values  defines  quotas  for   resource   attributes
     managed  via  this  queue.  The  syntax  is  the same as for
     load_thresholds (see above). The quotas are related  to  the
     resource  consumption  of all jobs in a queue in the case of
     consumable resources (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for details on  consum-
     able  resources) or they are interpreted on a per queue slot
     (see slots  above)  basis  in  the  case  of  non-consumable
     resources.  Consumable resource attributes are commonly used
     to manage free memory, free disk space or available floating
     software  licenses  while  non-consumable attributes usually
     define distinctive characteristics  like  type  of  hardware
     installed.

     For consumable resource  attributes  an  available  resource
     amount  is  determined  by  subtracting the current resource
     consumption of all running jobs in the queue from the  quota
     in the complex_values list. Jobs can only be dispatched to a
     queue if  no  resource  requests  exceed  any  corresponding
     resource  availability  obtained  by  this scheme. The quota
     definition  in  the  complex_values  list  is  automatically
     replaced  by the current load value reported for this attri-
     bute, if load is monitored for  this  resource  and  if  the
     reported  load  value is more stringent than the quota. This
     effectively avoids oversubscription of resources.

     Note: Load values replacing  the  quota  specifications  may
     have  become  more  stringent  because they have been scaled
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B>) and/or load adjusted (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).
     The  -<I>F</I>  option  of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>  and  the  load display in the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> queue control dialog (activated  by  clicking  on  a
     queue  icon  while  the  "Shift"  key  is  pressed)  provide
     detailed information on the actual availability  of  consum-
     able  resources  and  on the origin of the values taken into
     account currently.

     Note also: The resource consumption of  running  jobs  (used
     for  the  availability  calculation) as well as the resource
     requests of the jobs waiting to be dispatched either may  be
     derived  from  explicit  user requests during job submission
     (see the -<I>l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>) or  from  a  "default"  value
     configured  for  an attribute by the administrator (see <I>com-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html">plex(5)</A></B>).  The  -<I>r</I>  option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>  can  be  used  for
     retrieving  full  detail  on the actual resource requests of
     all jobs in the system.

     For non-consumable resources Grid Engine simply compares the
     job's  attribute  requests with the corresponding specifica-
     tion in complex_values taking the relation operator  of  the
     complex  attribute definition into account (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).
     If the result of the comparison  is  "true",  the  queue  is
     suitable  for  the job with respect to the particular attri-
     bute. For parallel jobs each queue slot to be occupied by  a
     parallel  task  is meant to provide the same resource attri-
     bute value.

     Note: Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as con-
     sumable  resources  and  hence  non-numeric  attributes  are
     always handled on a per queue slot basis.

     The default value  for  this  parameter  is  NONE,  i.e.  no
     administrator   defined   resource   attribute   quotas  are
     associated with the queue.

  calendar
     specifies the calendar to be valid for this  queue  or  con-
     tains  NONE (the default). A calendar defines the availabil-
     ity of a queue depending on time  of  day,  week  and  year.
     Please  refer  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>  for details on the Grid
     Engine calendar facility.

     Note: Jobs can request queues with a certain calendar  model
     via a "-<I>l</I> <I>c</I>=&lt;<I>cal</I>_<I>name</I>&gt;" option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>.

  initial_state
     defines an initial state for the queue  either  when  adding
     the queue to the system for the first time or on start-up of
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the host on  which  the  queue  resides.
     Possible values are:

     default   The queue is enabled when adding the queue  or  is
               reset  to  the  previous  status when <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
               comes up (this corresponds to the behavior in ear-
               lier   Grid   Engine   releases   not   supporting
               initial_state).

     enabled   The queue is  enabled  in  either  case.  This  is
               equivalent to a manual and explicit '<I>qmod</I> -<I>e</I>' com-
               mand (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>).

     disabled  The queue is  disable  in  either  case.  This  is
               equivalent to a manual and explicit '<I>qmod</I> -<I>d</I>' com-
               mand (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>).

RESOURCE LIMITS
     The first two resource limit parameters, s_rt and h_rt,  are
     implemented  by  Grid Engine. They define the "real time" or
     also called "elapsed" or "wall  clock"  time  having  passed
     since  the  start  of  the job. If h_rt is exceeded by a job
     running in the queue, it is aborted via the  SIGKILL  signal
     (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>).   If  s_rt  is  exceeded,  the  job is first
     "warned" via the SIGUSR1 signal (which can be caught by  the
     job) and finally aborted after the notification time defined
     in the queue configuration parameter notify (see above)  has
     passed.

     The resource limit parameters s_cpu  and  h_cpu  are  imple-
     mented by Grid Engine as a job limit. They impose a limit on
     the  amount  of  combined  CPU  time  consumed  by  all  the
     processes  in the job. If h_cpu is exceeded by a job running
     in the queue, it  is  aborted  via  a  SIGKILL  signal  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>).   If  s_cpu is exceeded, the job is sent a SIGXCPU
     signal which can be caught by the job. If you wish to  allow
     a  job to be "warned" so it can exit gracefully before it is
     killed then you should set the s_cpu limit to a lower  value
     than  h_cpu.   For  parallel processes, the limit is applied
     per slot which means that the limit  is  multiplied  by  the
     number of slots being used by the job before being applied.

     The resource limit parameters s_vmem and h_vmem  are  imple-
     mented by Grid Engine as a job limit. They impose a limit on
     the amount of combined virtual memory consumed  by  all  the
     processes in the job. If h_vmem is exceeded by a job running
     in the queue, it  is  aborted  via  a  SIGKILL  signal  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>).   If s_vmem is exceeded, the job is sent a SIGXCPU
     signal which can be caught by the job.  If you wish to allow
     a  job to be "warned" so it can exit gracefully before it is
     killed then you should set the s_vmem limit to a lower value
     than  h_vmem.   For parallel processes, the limit is applied
     per slot which means that the limit  is  multiplied  by  the
     number of slots being used by the job before being applied.

     The remaining parameters in the queue configuration template
     specify per job soft and hard resource limits as implemented
     by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> system call. See  this  manual  page  on
     your  system  for  more information.  By default, each limit
     field is set  to  infinity  (which  means  RLIM_INFINITY  as
     described  in  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> manual page). The value type
     for the CPU-time limits s_cpu and h_cpu is time.  The  value
     type  for the other limits is memory.  Note: Not all systems
     support <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B>.

     Note also: s_vmem  and  h_vmem  (virtual  memory)  are  only
     available    on    systems   supporting   RLIMIT_VMEM   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> on your operating system).

     The UNICOS operating system supplied by  SGI/Cray  does  not
     support  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B>  system  call,  using  their  own
     resource limit-setting system call instead.  For UNICOS sys-
     tems only, the following meanings apply:

     s_cpu     The per-process CPU time limit in seconds.

     s_core    The per-process maximum core file size in bytes.

     s_data    The per-process maximum memory limit in bytes.

     s_vmem    The same as s_data (if both are set the minimum is
               used).

     h_cpu     The per-job CPU time limit in seconds.

     h_data    The per-job maximum memory limit in bytes.

     h_vmem    The same as h_data (if both are set the minimum is
               used).

     h_fsize   The total number of disk blocks that this job  can
               create.
