<p>
A project's working files and documents are made available for viewing and sharing through the <b>Project Documents</b> page. These can be binary or other file format uploads, URLs, and HTML pages. Any working documents displayed here are under project version control.
<p>Project documents are distinct from what you can find and download in the <b>Project Files</b> page. While either place may feature many different kinds of files and documents, the chief difference is that project documents are works in progress, whereas project files available for download are more or less finished products, the results of the project's efforts to date, and are not under version control.
<p>

<a name="viewdocs"></a><span class="InputHeader">Viewing project documents</span>
<p>
Anyone can view working project documents for open source projects; you do not have to be a project member. Private project documents are restricted to project members, however.
<p>
To view project documents, from the <b>Project Home</b> page or any project page that displays the Project Resources toolbar, click the <i>Documentation</i> link.  The <b>Project Documents</b> page displays files and documents organized by sections, much like an outline. Clicking on the document or filename link displays the contents in your browser window.
<p>

<p>
If you are a member of a project, you can include files or documents in the <b>Project Documents</b> page by suggesting these to the Project Owner for his/her approval. You can also suggest new sections for organizing the <b>Project Documents</b> page. As a project member, your view of this page includes two links in the upper right corner: <i>Suggest New Document</i> and <i>Suggest New Section</i>.
<p>
Suggested documents should not exceed 25 MB in size. Documents larger than this cannot be uploaded.


<p>
Clicking <i>Suggest New Document</i> displays the <b>Add Project Document</b> page. Use the input fields in this page to enter the document name that will appear in the <b>Project Documents</b> page, a brief description, then select one of the three document options for submitting document:
<ul>
<li>Locate the file by browsing your local machine directories
<li>Enter the URL for online documents
<li>Cut and paste the document's HTML content directly into a text box.
</ul>
<p>
Choose which section the document should be placed in on the Project Documents page, or leave the default section selection, and click the "Add Document" button.
<p>
Until the Project Owner takes action, a link to your suggested document appears only in your view of the <b>Project Documents</b> page, but not to anyone else viewing this page. At any time, you can use the <i>Edit</i> link to modify the document title, description, or other fields, or you use the <i>Delete</i> link to remove the document.
<p>
If your suggested document is not approved, you will receive an email notification with the reason for this action.
