<p><b>Happy 1st year anniversary to the Grid Engine Project</b>
<p>The Grid Engine project was launched on July 23, 2001.  To find out more
about how the community has grown since then, 
<a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=5893&listName=users">read the post</a>
about the progress made in the project's first year.
<!-- anniversary note -->

<p><b>What is the Grid Engine project?</b>
<p>The Grid Engine project is an open source community effort to facilitate
the adoption of distributed computing solutions. Sponsored by <a href="http://www.sun.com/gridware" target="_blank">Sun
Microsystems</a> and hosted by <a href="http://www.collab.net" target="_blank">CollabNet</a>,
the Grid Engine project provides enabling distributed resource management
software for wide ranging requirements from compute farms to grid computing.

<p>By any use of this Website, you agreed to be bound by these <a href="http://www.sunsource.net/TUPPCP.html">Policies and Terms
of Use</a>.</p>

<p><b>Mission</b>
<p>The Grid Engine project is about expanding the application and use of
distributed computing. We want to:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Advance Grid Engine technology</li>

<li>
Establish community-driven standards for distributed computing</li>

<li>
Enable developers to create innovative services and applications across
distributed heterogeneous compute environments</li>
</ul>
We've outlined an overall vision and set of objectives guiding our development
process. You can view them in our <a href="background.html">introduction
page</a> and our <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.
<p><b>About This Site</b>
<p>This site is a base for continued collaborative development of the Grid
Engine project. You will find Grid Engine distributed resource management
software here, as well as evolving ideas for continued evolution of the
code. We hope you will find the Grid Engine project useful in the deployment
of your distributed computing applications.
