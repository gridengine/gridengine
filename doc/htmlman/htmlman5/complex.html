NAME
     complex - Grid Engine complexes configuration file format

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Complex</I> reflects the format of the Grid Engine complex  con-
     figuration.   The  definition of complex attributes provides
     all pertinent information concerning the resource attributes
     a  user may request for a Grid Engine job via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -l
     option and for the interpretation of these parameters within
     the Grid Engine system.

     The Grid Engine complex object defines all entries which are
     used for configuring the global, the host, and queue object.
     The system has a set  of  pre  defined  entries,  which  are
     assigned  to a host or queue per default.  In a addition can
     the user define new entries and assign them to one or multi-
     ple  objects.  Each load value has to have its corresbonding
     complex entry object, which defines the type and  the  rela-
     tional operator for it.

  defining resource attributes
     The complex configuration should not be  accessed  directly.
     In  order  to  add  or modify complexe entries, the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>
     options -Mc and -mc should be used instead.  While  the  -Mc
     option  take a <I>complex</I> configuration file as an argument and
     overrides the current configuration, the -mc option bring up
     an  editor  filled in with the current .I complex configura-
     tion.

     The provided  list  contains  all  definitions  of  resource
     attributes  in  the system. Adding a new entry means to pro-
     vide: name, shortcut, type, relop, requestable,  consumable,
     default,  and rgency. The fields are described below. Chang-
     ing one is easily done by updated the field  to  change  and
     removing  an  entry by deleting its definition. An attribute
     can only be removed, when it is not referenced in a host  or
     queue  object  anymore.  Also  does the system have a set of
     default resource attributes which are always attrached to  a
     host  or  queue.  They cannot be deleted nor can the type of
     such an attribute be changed.

  working with resource attributes
     Before a user can request a resource attribute it has to  be
     attached to the global, host, or cqueue object. The resource
     attribute exists only for the objects, it got  attached  to(
     if it is attached to the global object(qconf -me global), it
     exits sytem wide, host object: only on that host (qconf  -me
     NAME): cqueue object: only on that cqueue (qconf -mq NAME).

     When the user attached a resource attribute  to  an  object,
     one  also  has  to assign a value to it; the resource limit.
     Another way to get a resource attribute  value  is  done  by
     configuring a load sensor for that attribute.

  Default queue resource attributes
     In its default form it contains a selection of parameters in
     the  queue  configuration  as defined in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.  The
     queue configuration parameters being requestable for  a  job
     by the user in principal are:

          qname
          hostname
          notify
          calendar
          min_cpu_interval
          tmpdir
          seq_no
          s_rt
          h_rt
          s_cpu
          h_cpu
          s_data
          h_data
          s_stack
          h_stack
          s_core
          h_core
          s_rss
          h_rss

  Default host resource attributes
     The standard set of host related attributes consists of  two
     categories. he first category is built by several queue con-
     figuration attributes which are particularly suitable to  be
     managed on a host basis. These attributes are:

          slots
          s_vmem
          h_vmem
          s_fsize
          h_fsize
     (please refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).

     Note: Defining these attributes in the host  complex  is  no
     contradiction  to  having  them also in the queue configura-
     tion. It allows maintaining the corresponding resources on a
     host level and at the same time on a queue level. Total vir-
     tual free memory (h_vmem) can be managed  for  a  host,  for
     example,  and a subset of the total amount can be associated
     with a queue on that host.

     The second attribute category in the standard  host  complex
     are  the default load values Every <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> periodically
     reports load to <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  The  reported  load  values
     are  either the standard Grid Engine load values such as the
     CPU load average (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/uptime.html">uptime(1)</A></B>) or load values  defined  by
     the  Grid Engine administration (see the load_sensor parame-
     ter in the cluster configuration <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>  and  the  <I>Grid</I>
     <I>Engine</I>  <I>Installation</I>  <I>and</I> <I>Administration</I> <I>Guide</I> for details).
     The characteristics definition for the standard load  values
     is  part  of  the  default host complex, while administrator
     defined load values require extension of the  host  complex.
     Please  refer to the file &lt;sge_root&gt;/doc/load_parameters.asc
     for detailed information on the standard set of load values.

  Overriding attributes
     One attribute can be assigned to  the  global  object,  host
     object, and queue object at the same time. On the host level
     it might get its value from the user defined resource  limit
     and  a  load sensor. In case that the attribute is a consum-
     able, we have in addition to the resource limit and its load
     report on host level also the internal usage, which the sys-
     tem keeps track of. The mergin is done as follows:

     In general an attribute can be overridden on a lower level
        - global by hosts and queues
        - hosts by queues and load values or resource  limits  on
     the same level.

     We have one limitation for overriding  attributes  based  on
     its relational operator:

     !=, == operators can only be overridden on the  same  level,
     but  not  on  a  lower  level. The user defined value always
     overrides the load value.

     &gt;=, &gt;, &lt;=, &lt; operators can only be overridden, when the  new
     value is more restrictive than the old one.

     In the case of a consumable on host level, which has also  a
     load sensor, the system checks for the current usage, and if
     the internal accouting is more  restrictive  than  the  load
     sensor  report, the internal value is kept; if the load sen-
     sour report is more restrictive, that one is kept.

FORMAT
     The principal format of a <I>complex</I> configuration is that of a
     tabulated list. Each line starting with a '#' character is a
     comment line. Each line despite  comment  lines  define  one
     element  of  the complex. A element definition line consists
     of the following 8 column entries per line (in the order  of
     appearance):

  name
     The name of the complex element to be used to  request  this
     attribute  for  a job in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option. An attribute
     name may appear only once across  all  complexes,  i.e.  the
     complex attribute definition is unique.

  shortcut
     A shortcut for name which may also be used to  request  this
     attribute  for  a job in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option. An attribute
     shortcut may appear only once across all complexes, so as to
     avoid  the possibility of ambiguous complex attribute refer-
     ences.

  type
     This setting determines how the corresponding values are  to
     be  treated Grid Engine internally in case of comparisons or
     in case of load scaling for the load complex entries:

     <B>o</B>  With INT only raw integers are allowed.

     <B>o</B>  With DOUBLE floating point numbers  in  double  precision
        (decimal and scientific notation) can be specified.

     <B>o</B>  With  TIME  time  specifiers  are   allowed.   Refer   to
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for a format description.

     <B>o</B>  With MEMORY memory size specifiers are allowed. Refer  to
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for a format description.

     <B>o</B>  With BOOL the strings TRUE and FALSE  are  allowed.  When
        used in a load formula (refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> ) TRUE and
        FALSE get mapped into '1' and '0'.

     <B>o</B>  With STRING all strings are allowed and <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/strcmp.html">strcmp(3)</A></B> is used
        for comparisons.

     <B>o</B>  CSTRING is like STRING except comparisons are case insen-
        sitive.

     <B>o</B>  RESTRING is like STRING with regular expression matching.
        The syntax follows the following rules:

         - "*"   : matches any character and any number of chars
                   (between 0 and inv).
         - "?"   : matches any character. It cannot be no
                   character
         - "."   : is the character ".". It has no other meaning
         - "\"   : escape character. "\\" = "\", "\*" = "*",
                   "\?" = "?"
         - "[xx]": specifies an array or a range of allowed
                   characters for one character at a specific
                   position
         - "|"   : logical "or". Can only be used on the highest
                   level and cannot be escaped.

        Examples:
         -l arch="*linux|solaris*"  :
              results in "arch=linux" OR "arch=glinux"
                 OR "arch=alinus" OR "arch=solaris" OR
                 "arch=solaris64" OR "arch=solaris86" OR ...
         -l arch="[linux|solaris]"  :
              results in "arch=[linux" OR "arch=solaris]"


     <B>o</B>  HOST is like CSTRING but the string must be a valid host-
        name.

  relop
     The relation operator. The relation operator  is  used  when
     the  value  requested by the user for this parameter is com-
     pared against the corresponding  value  configured  for  the
     considered queues. If the result of the comparison is false,
     the job cannot run in this queue. Possible  relation  opera-
     tors  are  "==",  "&lt;",  "&gt;",  "&lt;="  and "&gt;=". The only valid
     operator for string type attributes is "==".

  requestable
     The entry can be used in a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> resource request if  this
     field  is  set  to 'y' or 'yes'.  If set to 'n' or 'no' this
     entry cannot be used by a user in order to request  a  queue
     or  a  class  of queues.  If the entry is set to 'forced' or
     'f' the attribute has to be requested by  a  job  or  it  is
     rejected.

     To enable resource request enforcement the existance of  the
     resource  has  to  be defined. This can be done on a cluster
     global, per host and per  queue  basis.  The  definition  of
     resource  availability  is performed with the complex_values
     entry in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queu_conf.html">queu_conf(5)</A></B>.

  consumable
     The consumable parameter can be set  to  either  'yes'  ('y'
     abbreviated)  or 'no' ('n'). It can be set to 'yes' only for
     numeric attributes (INT, DOUBLE, MEMORY,  TIME  -  see  type
     above). If set to 'yes' the consumption of the corresponding
     resource can be managed by Grid Engine internal bookkeeping.
     In  this  case  Grid  Engine accounts for the consumption of
     this resource for all running jobs and ensures that jobs are
     only  dispatched  if  the  Grid  Engine internal bookkeeping
     indicates enough available consumable resources. Consumables
     are  an  efficient  means to manage limited resources such a
     available memory, free  space  on  a  file  system,  network
     bandwidth or floating software licenses.

     Consumables can be combined with  default  or  user  defined
     load  parameters  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>  and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B>), i.e.
     load values can be reported for consumable attributes or the
     consumable  flag  can  be  set for load attributes. The Grid
     Engine consumable resource management takes  both  the  load
     (measuring  availability  of  the resource) and the internal
     bookkeeping into account in this case, and makes  sure  that
     neither of both exceeds a given limit.

     To enable consumable resource management the  basic  availa-
     bility  of a resource has to be defined. This can be done on
     a cluster global, per host and per queue basis  while  these
     categories may supersede each other in the given order (i.e.
     a host can restrict availability of a cluster resource and a
     queue  can restrict host and cluster resources). The defini-
     tion  of  resource  availability  is  performed   with   the
     complex_values entry in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.  The
     complex_values definition of  the  "global"  host  specifies
     cluster  global consumable settings. To each consumable com-
     plex attribute in a complex_values list a value is  assigned
     which   denotes   the  maximum  available  amount  for  that
     resource. The internal bookkeeping will subtract  from  this
     total  the  assumed resource consumption by all running jobs
     as expressed through the jobs' resource requests.

     Note: Jobs can be forced to request a resource and  thus  to
     specify  their  assumed consumption via the 'force' value of
     the requestable parameter (see above).

     Note also: A default resource consumption value can be  pre-
     defined  by  the administrator for consumable attributes not
     explicitly requested by the job (see the  default  parameter
     below).  This is meaningful only if requesting the attribute
     is not enforced as explained above.

     See the <I>Grid</I> <I>Engine</I> <I>Installation</I>  <I>and</I>  <I>Administration</I>  <I>Guide</I>
     for examples on the usage of the consumable resources facil-
     ity.

  default
     Meaningful only for consumable complex attributes (see  con-
     sumable  parameter  above). Grid Engine assumes the resource
     amount denoted in the default  parameter  implicitly  to  be
     consumed  by jobs being dispatched to a host or queue manag-
     ing the consumable attribute. Jobs explicitly requesting the
     attribute via the -<I>l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> override this default
     value.

  urgency
     The urgency value allows influencing job priorities on a per
     resource base. The urgency value effects the addend for each
     resource  when  determining  the  resource  request  related
     urgency contribution. For numeric type resource requests the
     addend is the product of the urgency value, the jobs assumed
     slot allocation and the per slot request as specified via -<I>l</I>
     option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>.  For string type requests  the  resources
     urgency value is directly used as addend. Urgency values are
     of type real. See under <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B> for an  overview  on
     job priorities.
