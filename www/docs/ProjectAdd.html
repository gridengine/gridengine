<p>This document describes the process of creating a project to be hosted on this site. You must be a registered user and you must be logged in to start a project.

<p>Creating a new project on this site is fairly straightforward. In these help pages, we will walk you through the process. You should, however, come to the task prepared, with a good sense of what you want and how you want to accomplish it. Knowing whom to invite onto your project won't hurt, either. 
<p>The <STRONG>Start a Project </STRONG>link on your Start Page (and several other pages) leads you through a three-step process to turn your idea into a pending project. Once you complete this process--and it doesn't take long--a special home page specific to your project is generated. Your project home page is the focal point for everything having to do with your project, and all registered users can view it. It is therefore important that you create a page that is as informative as it is inviting. 
<p>In <a href="ProjectAddStep1.html">Project Add Fields Explained</A>, 
  we address each field in the "Add a New Project page."</p>
