SYNOPSIS
     qacct [ -A Account ] [ -b BeginTime ] [ -d Days ] [ -e  End-
     Time  ] [ -g [GroupId|GroupName] ] [ -h [HostName] ] [ -help
     ] [ -history HistoryPath ]  [  -j  [JobId|JobName]  ]  [  -l
     attr=val,... ] [ -nohist ] [ -o [Owner] ] [ -pe [PEname] ] [
     -q   [Q_name]   ]   [   -slots   [SlotNumber]   ]    [    -t
     task_id_range_list  ] [ -P [Project] ] [ -D [Department] ] [
     -f <I>AcctFileName</I> ]

DESCRIPTION
     The <I>qacct</I>  utility  scans  the  accounting  data  file  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/accounting.html">accounting(5)</A></B>)  and  produces  a  summary of information for
     wall-clock  time,  cpu-time,  and  system   time   for   the
     categories  of hostname, queue-name, group-name, owner-name,
     job-name, job-ID and for the  queues  meeting  the  resource
     requirements  as specified with the -l switch.  Combinations
     of  each  category  are  permitted.  Alternatively,  all  or
     specific jobs can be listed with the -j switch.  For example
     the search criteria could include summarizing  for  a  queue
     and an owner, but not for two queues in the same request.

OPTIONS
     -A Account
          The account for jobs to be summarized.

     -b BeginTime
          The earliest start time for jobs to be  summarized,  in
          the format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also -d option.

     -d Days
          The number of days to summarize  and  print  accounting
          information  on. If used together with the -b BeginTime
          option (see above), jobs started  within  BeginTime  to
          BeginTime + Days are counted. If used together with the
          -e EndTime (see below) option, count starts at  EndTime
          - Days.

     -e EndTime
          The latest start time for jobs to be summarized, in the
          format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also -d option.

     [-f AcctFileName]
          The accounting file to be used. If omitted, the  system
          default accounting file is processed.

     -g [GroupId|GroupName]
          The numeric system group id or the  group  alphanumeric
          name  of  the job owners to be included in the account-
          ing. If GroupId/GroupName is omitted,  all  groups  are
          accounted.

     -h [HostName]
          The  case-insensitive  name  of  the  host  upon  which
          accounting  information  is  requested.  If the name is
          omitted, totals for each host are listed separately.

     -help
          Display help information for the <I>qacct</I> command.

     -history HistoryPath
          The directory path where the <I>historical</I> queue and  com-
          plexes configuration data is located, which is used for
          resource requirement matching in conjunction  with  the
          -l  switch.   If  the latter is not set, this option is
          ignored.

     -j [[JobName|JobId]]
          The name or ID of the job during  execution  for  which
          accounting  information  is  printed. If neither a name
          nor an ID is given all jobs are enlisted.
          This option changes the  output  format  of  <I>qacct</I>.  If
          activated,  CPU times are no longer accumulated but the
          "raw" accounting information is printed in a  formatted
          form  instead.  See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/accounting.html">accounting(5)</A></B> for an explanation of
          the displayed information.

     -l attr=val,...
          A resource requirement specification which must be  met
          by  the  queues  in which the jobs being accounted were
          executing. The matching is  performed  with  <I>historical</I>
          data,  i.e.  it reflects the situation of the queue and
          complexes configuration at the time of the job start.

          The  resource  request  is  very  similar  to  the  one
          described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>.  The main difference is that ever
          changing load information may not be requested as it is
          not  contained  in  the  historical  configuration data
          being used.

     -nohist
          Only useful together with  the  -l  option.  It  forces
          <I>qacct</I>  not to use <I>historical</I> queue and complexes confi-
          guration data for  resource  requirement  matching  but
          instead  retrieve actual queue and complexes configura-
          tion from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  Note, that this may lead  to
          confusing statistical results, as the current queue and
          complexes configuration may differ  significantly  from
          the  situation  being  valid for past jobs.  Note also,
          that all hosts being referenced in the accounting  file
          have to be up and running in order to get results.

     -o [Owner]
          The name of the owner of the jobs for which  accounting
          statistics  are  assembled. If the optional Owner argu-
          ment is omitted, a listing of the accounting statistics
          of  all job owners being present in the accounting file
          is produced.

     -pe [PEname]
          The name of the parallel environment for which usage is
          summarized.  If PEname is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each parallel environment separately.

     -q [Q_name]
          The name of the queue for which  usage  is  summarized.
          If  Q_name  is not given, accounting data is listed for
          each queue separately.

     -slots [SlotNumber]
          The number of queue slots for which  usage  is  summar-
          ized.   If  SlotNumber is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each number of queue slots separately.

     -t task_id_range_list
          Only available together with the  -j  option  described
          above.

          The -t switch specifies the job array task  range,  for
          which  accounting information should be printed. Syntax
          and semantics of task_id_range_list  are  identical  to
          that  one  described  under  the  -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>.
          Please see there also for further  information  on  job
          arrays.

     -P [Project]
          The name of the project for which usage is  summarized.
          If  Project is not given, accounting data is listed for
          each owner project separately. Projects are  only  used
          when running in Grid Engine Enterprise Edition mode.

     -D [Department]
          The name of the department for which usage  is  summar-
          ized.   If  Department is not given, accounting data is
          listed for each owner  department  separately.  Depart-
          ments  are only used when running in Grid Engine Enter-
          prise Edition mode.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Grid Engine cell <I>qacct</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine  communication  of  the  <I>qacct</I>  client
                    resides.  Per default the local host is used.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>accounting</I>
                     Grid Engine default accounting file
