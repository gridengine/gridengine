NAME
     access_list - Grid Engine access list file format

DESCRIPTION
     Access lists are used in Grid Engine to define  access  per-
     missions  of users to queues (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) or parallel
     environments (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>).  A list of  currently  config-
     ured  access  lists  can  be displayed via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> -sul
     option. The contents of each enlisted access list can  shown
     via  the -su switch. The output follows the <I>access</I>_<I>list</I> for-
     mat description. New access lists can be created and  exist-
     ing can be modified via the -au and -du options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     Departments are a special form of access list and  allow  in
     addition  assignment of functional shares and override tick-
     ets.

FORMAT
     The following list of <I>access</I>_<I>list</I> parameters  specifies  the
     <I>access</I>_<I>list</I> content:

  name
     The name of the access list.

  type
     The type of the acess list, currently  one  of <I>ACL</I>, or  <I>DEPT</I>
     or a  combination of both in a comma separated list. Depend-
     ing on this parameter the access list can be used as  access
     list only or as a department.

  oticket
     The amount of override tickets  currently  assigned  to  the
     department.

  fshare
     The current functional share of the department.

  entries
     The entries parameter contains the comma separated  list  of
     those  UNIX  users  or UNIX user groups that are assigned to
     the access list or the department. Only symbolic  names  are
     allowed.  A group is differentiated from a user name by pre-
     fixing the group name with a '@'  sign.  Pure  access  lists
     allows enlisting any user or group in any access list.

     With departments each user or group enlisted may be enlisted
     in  only  one  department,  to ensure a unique assignment of
     jobs to departments. To jobs whose users do not  match  with
     any  of  the  users  or  groups  enlisted  under entries the
     <I>defaultdepartment</I> is assigned, if existing.
