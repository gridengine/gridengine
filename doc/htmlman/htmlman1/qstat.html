DESCRIPTION
     <I>qstat</I> shows the current status of the available Grid  Engine
     queues  and  the  jobs associated with the queues. Selection
     options allow you to get information  about  specific  jobs,
     queues or users.  Without any option <I>qstat</I> will display only
     a list of jobs with no queue status information.

OPTIONS
     -explain a|A|c|E
          'c' displays the reason for the configuration  ambigous
          state of a queue instance. 'a' shows the reason for the
          alarm  state.  Suspend  alarm  state  reasons  will  be
          displayed  by  'A'. 'E' displays the reason for a queue
          instance error state.

          The output format for the alarm reasons is one line per
          reason containing the resource value and threshold. For
          details about the resource value please  refer  to  the
          description  of  the Full Format in section OUTPUT FOR-
          MATS below.

     -ext Displays additional information for each job related to
          the  job  ticket  policy  scheme  (see  OUTPUT  FORMATS
          below).

     -f   Specifies a "full" format display of information.   The
          -f  option  causes summary information on all queues to
          be displayed along with the queued job list.

     -F [ resource_name,... ]
          Like in the case of -f information is displayed on  all
          jobs as well as queues. In addition, <I>qstat</I> will present
          a detailed listing of the current resource availability
          per  queue with respect to all resources (if the option
          argument is omitted) or with respect to those resources
          contained  in  the  resource_name list. Please refer to
          the description of the Full Format  in  section  OUTPUT
          FORMATS below for further detail.

     -g {c|d|t}[+]
          The  -g  option  allows  for  controlling  grouping  of
          displayed objects.

          With -g c a cluster queue summary  is  displayed.  Find
          more information in the section OUTPUT FORMATS.

          With -g d array jobs are displayed verbosely in  a  one
          line  per  job task fashion. By default, array jobs are
          grouped and all tasks with the same status (for pending
          tasks  only)  are displayed in a single line. The array
          job task id range field in the output (see section OUT-
          PUT FORMATS) specifies the corresponding set of tasks.

          With -g t parallel jobs are displayed  verbosely  in  a
          one  line  per  parallel job task fashion. By  default,
          parallel job tasks are displayed in a single line. Also
          with  -g t option the function of each parallel task is
          displayed rather than the jobs slot amount (see section
          OUTPUT FORMATS).


     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -j [job_list]
          Prints either for all pending jobs  or  the  jobs  con-
          tained  in job_list the reason for not being scheduled.
          The job_list can contain job_ids,  job_names,  or  pat-
          terns.


     -l resource[=value],...
          Defines the resources required by the jobs  or  granted
          by the queues on which information is requested. Match-
          ing  is  performed  on  queues  based  on   non-mutable
          resource availability information only. That means load
          values are always ignored except the  so-called  static
          load  values  (i.e.  "arch",  "num_proc",  "mem_total",
          "swap_total" and "virtual_total") ones. Also consumbale
          utilization  is  ignored.   The  pending  jobs are res-
          tricted to jobs that might run  in  one  of  the  above
          queues.  In a similar fashion also the queue-job match-
          ing bases only  on  non-mutable  resource  availability
          information.

     -ne  In  combination  with  -f  the  option  suppresses  the
          display  of  empty  queues. This means all queues where
          actually no jobs are running are not displayed.

     -pe pe_name,...
          Displays status  information  with  respect  to  queues
          which  are  attached  to  at  least one of the parallel
          environments enlisted in  the  comma  separated  option
          argument.  Status  information  for  jobs  is displayed
          either for those which execute in one of  the  selected
          queues  or which are pending and might get scheduled to
          those queues in principle.

     -q wc_queue_list
          Specifies a wildcard queue list to which  job  informa-
          tion  is  to  be  displayed.  Find  the  definition  of
          wc_queue_list in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

     -qs {a|c|d|o|s|u|A|C|D|E|S}
          Similar to -f. It generates the same output, but allows
          to filter for queue instances in certain states.

     -r   Prints extended information about the resource require-
          ments of the displayed jobs. Please refer to the OUTPUT
          FORMATS sub-section Expanded Format below for  detailed
          information.

     -s {p|r|s|z|hu|ho|hs|hj|ha|h}[+]

          Prints only jobs in the specified state,  any  combina-
          tion  of  states is possible. -s prs corresponds to the
          regular  <I>qstat</I>  output  without  -s  at  all.  To  show
          recently  finished  jobs, use -s z.  To display jobs in
          user/operator/system hold, use the -s hu/ho/hs  option.
          The  -s ha option shows jobs which where submitted with
          the <I>qsub</I> -a command. <I>qstat</I>  -s  hj  displays  all  jobs
          which are not eligible for execution unless the job has
          entries  in  the  job  dependency  list.  (see  -a  and
          -hold_jid option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

     -t   Prints extended information about the  controlled  sub-
          tasks  of  the displayed parallel jobs. Please refer to
          the OUTPUT FORMATS sub-section Reduced Format below for
          detailed information. Sub-tasks of parallel jobs should
          not be confused with array job  tasks  (see  -g  option
          above and -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

     -U user,...
          Displays status information with respect to  queues  to
          which  the specified users have access. Status informa-
          tion for jobs is displayed either for those which  exe-
          cute in one of the selected queues or which are pending
          and might get scheduled to those queues in principle.

     -u user,...
          Display information only on those jobs and queues being
          associated  with  the  users  from the given user list.
          Queue status information is displayed if the -f  or  -F
          options are specified additionally and if the user runs
          jobs in those queues.

     -urg Displays additional information for each job related to
          the  job  urgency  policy  scheme  (see  OUTPUT FORMATS
          below).

     -xml This option can be used  with  all  other  options  and
          changes  the output to XML. The used schemas are refer-
          enced in the XML  output.  The  output  is  printed  to
          stdout.

OUTPUT FORMATS
     Depending on the presence or absence of  the  -explain,  -f,
     -F, or -qs and -r and -t option three output formats need to
     be differentiated.

     The -ext and -urg options may be used to display  additional
     information for each job.

  Cluster Queue Format (with -g c)
     Following the header line a section for each  cluster  queue
     is  provided. When queue instances selection are applied (-l
     -pe, -q, -U) the cluster format contains only cluster queues
     of the corresponding queue instances.

     <B>o</B>  the cluster queue name.

     <B>o</B>  an average of the normalized load average  of  all  queue
        hosts.  In order to reflect each hosts different signifi-
        cance the number of configured slots is used as a weight-
        ing  factor  when  determining cluster queue load. Please
        note that only hosts with a np_load_value are  considered
        for this value. When queue selection is applied only data
        about selected queues is considered in this  formula.  If
        the  load  value  is not available at any of the hosts '-
        NA-' is printed instead of the  value  from  the  complex
        attribute definition.

     <B>o</B>  the number of currently used slots.

     <B>o</B>  the number of currently available slots.

     <B>o</B>  the total number of slots.

     <B>o</B>  the number of slots which is in at least in  one  of  the
        states  'aoACDS' and in none of the states 'cdsuE'

     <B>o</B>  the number of slots which are in one of these  states  or
        in any  combination of them: 'cdsuE'

     <B>o</B>  the -g c option can be used in combination with -ext.  In
        this  case  additional  collumns are added to the output.
        Each collumn contains the  slot  count  for  one  of  the
        available queue states.

  Reduced Format (without -f, -F, and -qs)
     Following the header line a line is  printed  for  each  job
     consisting of

     <B>o</B>  the job ID.

     <B>o</B>  the priority of the job determining its position  in  the
        pending  jobs  list.   The  priority  value is determined
        dynamically based on ticket  and  urgency  policy  set-up
        (see also <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B> ).

     <B>o</B>  the name of the job.

     <B>o</B>  the user name of the job owner.

     <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of d(eletion), t(ransfering),
        r(unning),    R(estarted),    s(uspended),   S(uspended),
        T(hreshold), w(aiting) or h(old).

        The state d(eletion) indicates that a  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>  has  been
        used  to  initiate job deletion. The states t(ransfering)
        and r(unning) indicate that a job is about to be executed
        or  is already executing, whereas the states s(uspended),
        S(uspended) and T(hreshold) show that an already  running
        jobs  has been suspended. The s(uspended) state is caused
        by suspending  the  job  via  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>  command,  the
        S(uspended) state indicates that the queue containing the
        job is suspended and therefore the job is also  suspended
        and the T(hreshold) state shows that at least one suspend
        threshold of the corresponding queue  was  exceeded  (see
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  and  that the job has been suspended as a
        consequence. The state R(estarted) indicates that the job
        was  restarted.  This can be caused by a job migration or
        because of one of the reasons described in the -r section
        of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> command.

        The states w(aiting) and h(old) only appear  for  pending
        jobs.  The h(old) state indicates that a job currently is
        not eligible for execution due to a hold  state  assigned
        to it via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> or the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -h option or
        that the job is waiting for completion  of  the  jobs  to
        which  job dependencies have been assigned to the job via
        the -hold_jid option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B>.

     <B>o</B>  the submission or start time and date of the job.

     <B>o</B>  the  queue  the  job  is  assigned  to  (for  running  or
        suspended jobs only).

     <B>o</B>  the number of job slots or the function of  parallel  job
        tasks if -g t is specified.

        Without -g t option the total number  of  slots  occupied
        resp.  requested  by  the  job  is  diplayed. For pending
        parallel jobs with a PE slot range  request  the  assumed
        future  slot  allocation  is displayed.  With -g t option
        the function of the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE  -  the
        latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

     <B>o</B>  the array job task id. Will be empty for non-array  jobs.
        See  the  -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the -g above for addi-
        tional information.

     If the -t option is supplied, each status line  always  con-
     tains  parallel  job task information as if -g t were speci-
     fied and each line contains the following parallel job  sub-
     task information:

     <B>o</B>  the parallel task ID (do not confuse parallel tasks  with
        array job tasks),

     <B>o</B>  the status of the  parallel  task  -  one  of  r(unning),
        R(estarted),   s(uspended),   S(uspended),   T(hreshold),
        w(aiting), h(old), or x(exited).

     <B>o</B>  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,

     <B>o</B>  the exit status of the parallel task,

     <B>o</B>  and the failure code and message for the parallel task.

  Full Format (with -f and -F)
     Following the header line a section for each queue separated
     by  a horizontal line is provided. For each queue the infor-
     mation printed consists of

     <B>o</B>  the queue name,

     <B>o</B>  the  queue  type  -  one   of   B(atch),   I(nteractive),
        C(heckpointing),  P(arallel),  T(ransfer) or combinations
        thereof or N(one),

     <B>o</B>  the number of used and available job slots,

     <B>o</B>  the load average of the queue host,

     <B>o</B>  the architecture of the queue host and

     <B>o</B>  the state  of  the  queue  -  one  of  u(nknown)  if  the
        corresponding  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> cannot be contacted, a(larm),
        A(larm),     C(alendar      suspended),      s(uspended),
        S(ubordinate),  d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror) or combi-
        nations thereof.

     If the state is a(larm) at least on of the  load  thresholds
     defined  in the <I>load</I>_<I>thresholds</I> list of the queue configura-
     tion  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  is  currently  exceeded,   which
     prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue.

     As opposed to this, the  state  A(larm)  indicates  that  at
     least  one  of  the  suspend  thresholds  of  the queue (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) is currently exceeded. This  will  result  in
     jobs  running  in  that  queue  being successively suspended
     until no threshold is violated.

     The states s(uspended) and d(isabled)  can  be  assigned  to
     queues  and  released  via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command. Suspending a
     queue will cause all jobs executing  in  that  queue  to  be
     suspended.

     The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that
     the  queue  has been disabled or suspended automatically via
     the calendar facility of Grid Engine (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>),
     while  the S(ubordinate) state indicates, that the queue has
     been  suspend  via  subordination  to  another  queue   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details). When suspending a queue (regard-
     less of the cause) all jobs  executing  in  that  queue  are
     suspended too.

     If an E(rror) state is displayed for a  queue,  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     on  that  host was unable to locate the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> exe-
     cutable on that host in order to start a job.  Please  check
     the  error  logfile of that <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for leads on how to
     resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterwards  via
     the -c option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command manually.

     If the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state is  displayed  for  a
     queue  instance this indicates that the configuration speci-
     fied for this queue instance in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> is ambigous. The
     state  vanishes  when  the configuration becomes un-ambigous
     again. This state prevents from scheduling further  jobs  to
     that  queue  instance. Detailed reasons why a queue instance
     entered the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state can be found  in
     the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> messages file and are shown by the qstat
     -explain switch. For queue instances in this state the clus-
     ter  queue's  default  settings  are  used  for the ambigous
     attribute.

     If an o(rphaned) state is displayed  for  a  queue  instance
     this  indicates  that the current cluster queue's configura-
     tion and host group configuration does not any longer forsee
     this  queue instance. The queue instance is kept because not
     yet finished jobs are still associated and  it  will  vanish
     from  qstat  output when these jobs are finished. To quicken
     vanishing of an orphaned queue  instance  associated  job(s)
     can   be   deleted  using  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.   A  queue  instance  in
     (o)rphaned state can be  revived  by  changing  the  cluster
     queue   configuration   accordingly   to  cover  that  queue
     instance. This state prevents from scheduling  further  jobs
     to that queue instance.

     If the -F option was used, resource availability information
     is  printed  following  the  queue  status  line.  For  each
     resource (as selected in an option argument to -F or for all
     resources  if the option argument was omitted) a single line
     is displayed with the following format:

     <B>o</B>  a one letter specifier  indicating  whether  the  current
        resource availability value was dominated by either
        `g' - a cluster global,
        `h' - a host total or
        `q' - a queue related resource consumption.

     <B>o</B>  a second one letter specifier indicating the  source  for
        the current resource availability value, being one of
        `l' - a load value reported for the resource,
        `L' - a load value for the resource  after  administrator
        defined load scaling has been applied,
        `c' - availability derived from the consumable  resources
        facility (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complexes.html">complexes(5)</A></B>),
        `f' - a fixed  availability  definition  derived  from  a
        non-consumable  complex  attribute  or  a  fixed resource
        limit.

     <B>o</B>  after a colon the name of the resource on which  informa-
        tion is displayed.

     <B>o</B>  after an equal sign  the  current  resource  availability
        value.

     The displayed availability values and the sources from which
     they  derive  are  always the minimum values of all possible
     combinations.  Hence,  for  example,  a  line  of  the  form
     "qf:h_vmem=4G"  indicates  that a queue currently has a max-
     imum availability in virtual memory  of  4  Gigabyte,  where
     this  value  is  a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in the
     queue configuration) and it is  queue  dominated,  i.e.  the
     host  in  total  may have more virtual memory available than
     this, but the queue doesn't allow  for  more.  Contrarily  a
     line  "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an upper bound of 4
     Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but the limit would be
     derived  from  a load value currently reported for the host.
     So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher  virtual
     memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue
     resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

     If the -explain option was used with the  character  'a'  or
     'A',  information about resources is displayed, that violate
     load or suspend thresholds.
     The same format as with the -F option is used with following
     extensions:

     <B>o</B>  the line starts with the keyword `alarm'

     <B>o</B>  appended to the resource value is the type and  value  of
        the appropriate threshold

     After the queue status line (in case of -f) or the  resource
     availability  information  (in  case of -F) a single line is
     printed for each job running currently in this  queue.  Each
     job status line contains

     <B>o</B>  the job ID,

     <B>o</B>  the priority of the job determining its position  in  the
        pending  jobs  list.   The  priority  value is determined
        dynamically based on ticket  and  urgency  policy  set-up
        (see also <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B> ).

     <B>o</B>  the job name,

     <B>o</B>  the job owner name,

     <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering),  r(unning),
        R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see
        the Reduced Format section for detailed information),

     <B>o</B>  the submission or start time and date of the job.

     <B>o</B>  the number of job slots or the function of  parallel  job
        tasks if -g t is specified.

        Without -g t option the  number  of  slots  occupied  per
        queue resp. requested by the job is diplayed. For pending
        parallel jobs with a PE slot range  request  the  assumed
        future  slot  allocation  is displayed.  With -g t option
        the function of the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE  -  the
        latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

     If the -t option is supplied, each job status line also con-
     tains

     <B>o</B>  the task ID,

     <B>o</B>  the status of the task - one of  r(unning),  R(estarted),
        s(uspended), S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old),
        or x(exited) (see the Reduced Format section for detailed
        information),

     <B>o</B>  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,
     <B>o</B>  the exit status of the task,

     <B>o</B>  and the failure code and message for the task.

     Following the list of queue sections a <I>PENDING</I> <I>JOBS</I> list may
     be  printed in case jobs are waiting for being assigned to a
     queue.  A status line for  each  waiting  job  is  displayed
     being  similar  to the one for the running jobs. The differ-
     ences are that the status  for  the  jobs  is  w(aiting)  or
     h(old),  that  the  submit time and date is shown instead of
     the start time and that no function  is  displayed  for  the
     jobs.

     In very rare cases, e.g. if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> starts up from an
     inconsistent state in the job or queue spool files or if the
     clean queue (-cq) option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> is used,  <I>qstat</I>  cannot
     assign jobs to either the running or pending jobs section of
     the output. In this case as job status inconsistency (e.g. a
     job has a running status but is not assigned to a queue) has
     been detected. Such jobs are printed in an <I>ERROR</I>  <I>JOBS</I>  sec-
     tion  at  the very end of the output. The ERROR JOBS section
     should disappear upon  restart  of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.   Please
     contact  your Grid Engine support representative if you feel
     uncertain about the cause or effects of such jobs.

  Expanded Format (with -r)
     If the -r option was specified together with <I>qstat</I>, the fol-
     lowing information for each displayed job is printed (a sin-
     gle line for each of the following job characteristics):

     <B>o</B>  The job and master queue name.

     <B>o</B>  The hard and soft resource requirements  of  the  job  as
        specified  with  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option. The per resource
        addend when determining  the  jobs  urgency  contribution
        value is printed (see also <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B>).

     <B>o</B>  The requested parallel environment including the  desired
        queue slot range (see -pe option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

     <B>o</B>  The requested checkpointing environment of the  job  (see
        the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -ckpt option).

     <B>o</B>  In case of running jobs, the granted parallel environment
        with the granted number of queue slots.

     nurg The jobs total urgency value in normalized fashion.

     urg  The jobs total urgency value.

     rrcontr
          The  urgency  value  contribution  that  reflects   the

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Grid Engine cell <I>qstat</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

     SGE_LONG_QNAMES
                    Qstat does display queue names up to 30 char-
                    acters. If that is to much or not enough, one
                    can set a custom length with  this  variable.
                    The  minimum display length is 10 characters.
                    If one does not know the best display length,
                    one  can  set SGE_LONG_QNAMES to -1 and qstat
                    will figure out the best length.
