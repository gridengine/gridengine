.SH NAME
accounting \- xxQS_NAMExx accounting file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
An accounting record is written to the xxQS_NAMExx
accounting file for each job having finished. The accounting file is
processed by
.M qacct 1
to derive accounting statistics.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
Each job is represented by a line in the accounting file. Empty lines
and lines which contain one character or less are ignored.
Accounting record entries are
separated by colon (':') signs. The entries denote in their order
of appearance:
.IP "\fBqname\fP"
Name of the queue in which the job has run.
.IP "\fBhostname\fP"
Name of the execution host.
.IP "\fBgroup\fP"
The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.
.IP "\fBowner\fP"
Owner of the xxQS_NAMExx job.
.IP "\fBjob_name\fP"
Job name.
.IP "\fBjob_number\fP"
Job identifier - job number.
.IP "\fBaccount\fP"
An account string as specified by the
.M qsub 1
or
.M qalter 1
\fB\-A\fP option.
.IP "\fBpriority\fP"
Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the \fBpriority\fP
parameter in the queue configuration (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
.IP "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Submission time in seconds (since epoch format).
.IP "\fBstart_time\fP"
Start time in seconds (since epoch format).
.IP "\fBend_time\fP"
End time in seconds (since epoch format).
.IP "\fBfailed\fP"
Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started on 
the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a valid 
account on that machine). If xxQS_NAMExx tries to start a job multiple times, 
this may lead to multiple entries in the accounting file corresponding to 
the same job ID.
.IP "\fBexit_status\fP"
Exit status of the job script (or xxQS_NAMExx specific status in case
of certain error conditions).
.IP "\fBru_wallclock\fP"
Difference between \fBend_time\fP and \fBstart_time\fP (see above).
.PP
The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents of the
standard UNIX rusage structure as described in
.M getrusage 2 .

supported in case of a xxQS_NAME_EExx system.
.IP "\fBgranted_pe\fP"
The parallel environment which was selected for that job.
.IP "\fBslots\fP"
The number of slots which were dispatched to the job by the scheduler.
.IP "\fBtask_number\fP"
Array job task index number.
.IP "\fBcpu\fP"
The cpu time usage in seconds. 
.IP "\fBmem\fP"
The integral memory usage in Gbytes seconds. 
.IP "\fBio\fP"
The amount of data transferred in input/output operations.
.IP "\fBcategory\fP"
A string specifying the job category.
.IP "\fBiow\fP"
The io wait time in seconds.
.IP "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
If this identifier is set the task was part of a parallel job and was

.IP "\fBmaxvmem\fP"
The maximum vmem size in bytes.
