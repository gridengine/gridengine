.SH NAME
hostgroup \- host group entry file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A host group entry is used to merge host names to groups.
Each  host  group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a
group definition file you can also reference to groups. These
groups are called subgroups. A subgroup is referenced by the
sign "@" as first character of the name.
.PP
A list of currently configured host group entries can be displayed 
via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-shgrpl\fP option. The contents of each enlisted host group entry 
can be
shown via the \fB\-shgrp\fP switch. The output follows the
.I hostgroup
format description. New host group entries can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-ahgrp\fP, \fB\-mhgrp\fP, \fB\-dhgrp\fP and 
\fB\-?attr\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .

\fB@solaris64\fP and \fB@solaris32\fP.
