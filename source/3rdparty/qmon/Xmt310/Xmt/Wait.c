/*
 * The following procedure is by David Brooks of the OSF and appears in
 * the Motif FAQ list.  It has been renamed for the Xmt library.
 */

/*
 * This procedure will ensure that, if a dialog window is being mapped,
 * its contents become visible before returning.  It is intended to be
 * used just before a bout of computing that doesn't service the display.
 * You should still call XmUpdateDisplay() at intervals during this
 * computing if possible.
 *
 * The monitoring of window states is necessary because attempts to map
 * the dialog are redirected to the window manager (if there is one) and
 * this introduces a significant delay before the window is actually mapped
 * and exposed.  This code works under mwm, twm, uwm, and no-wm.  It
 * doesn't work (but doesn't hang) with olwm if the mainwindow is iconified.
 *
 * The argument to ForceDialog is any widget in the dialog (often it
 * will be the BulletinBoard child of a DialogShell).
