___INFO__MARK_END__

The load parameters reported by the execution daemon per default currently
are:

arch : An architecture string compiled into the cod_execd describing the
       operating system architecture for which the execd is targeted.
       Possible values are:

       aix43         for IBM AIX 4.3
       aix51         for IBM AIX 5.1
       hp11          for HP-UX 11.0
       irix65        for SGI IRIX 6.5
       lx24-amd64    for Linux 2.4.x (AMD64) glibc 2.2+ based
       lx24-x86      for Linux 2.4.x (x86) glibc 2.2+ based
       sol-sparc     for Sun Solaris (Sparc) 7 and higher, 32 bit kernel
       sol-sparc64   for Sun Solaris (Sparc) 7 and higher, 64 bit kernel
       sol-x86       for Sun Solaris (x86) 8 and higher
       tru64         for Compaq Tru64 Unix 5.0 and 5.1

       Note, that a sge_execd for a particular architecture may run on
       multiple OS versions.  In this case, the architecture string
       delivered by the execution daemon may be misleading.

num_proc : The number of processors provided by the execution host.  The
           host is in this case defined by a single Internet address, i.e. 
           rack mounted multi host systems are counted as a cluster rather
           than a single multi headed machine.

The following load information is not available under IBM AIX 4.3, 5.1. For
these operating systems the IBM loadsensor script in the Grid Engine
distribution in <sge_root>/util/resources/loadsensors needs to be installed:

load_short      : The short time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  first of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 1 minute average
                  with this value
load_medium     : The medium time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  second of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 5 minute average
                  with this value
load_long       : The long time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  third of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 10 or 15 minute
                  average with this value
load_avg        : The same as load_medium.
np_load_short   : The same as load_short but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
np_load_medium  : The same as load_medium but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
np_load_long    : The same as load_long but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
np_load_avg     : The same as load_avg but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.
cpu             : The percentage of CPU time not in idle state.

The following load information is NOT available under IBM AIX 4.3, 5.1:

mem_free        : The amount of free memory. 
swap_free       : The amount of free swap memory.
virtual_free    : The sum of mem_free and swap_free.
mem_used        : The amount of used memory. 
swap_used       : The amount of used swap space.
virtual_used    : The sum of mem_used and swap_used.
mem_total       : The total amount of memory (free+used).
swap_total      : The total amount of swap space (free+used).
virtual_total   : The sum of mem_total and swap_total.
