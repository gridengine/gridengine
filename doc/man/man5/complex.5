.SH NAME
complex \- xxQS_NAMExx complexes configuration file format
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Complex
reflects the format of the xxQS_NAMExx complex configuration.  The
definition of complex attributes provides all pertinent information
concerning the resource attributes a user may request for a xxQS_NAMExx
job via the
.M qsub 1
\fB\-l\fP option
and for the interpretation of these parameters within the xxQS_NAMExx
system.
.PP
The xxQS_NAMExx complex object defines all entries which are used for 
configuring the global, the host, and queue object. The system has a 
set of pre defined entries, which are assigned to a host or queue per default.
In a addition can the user define new entries and assign them to one or multiple
objects. Each load value has to have its corresbonding complex entry object, which
defines the type and the relational operator for it.
.\"
.SS "\fBdefining resource attributes\fP"
The complex configuration should not be accessed directly.
In order to add or modify complexe entries,
the
.M qconf 1
options -Mc and \-mc should be used instead.
While the \-Mc option take a
.I complex
configuration file as an argument and overrides the current configuration, 
the \-mc option bring up an editor filled in with the current .I complex
configuration.
.sp 1
The provided list contains all definitions of resource attributes in the system. Adding
a new entry means to provide: name, shortcut, type, relop, requestable, consumable, 
default, and rgency. The fields are described below. Changing one is easily done by 
updated the field to change and removing an entry by deleting its definition. An 
attribute can only be removed, when it is not referenced in a host or queue object 
anymore. Also does the system have a set of default resource attributes which are 
always attrached to a host or queue. They cannot be deleted nor can the type of 
such an attribute be changed.
.PP
.\"
.SS "\fBworking with resource attributes\fP"
Before a user can request a resource attribute it has to be attached to the global, host,
or cqueue object. The resource attribute exists only for the objects, it got attached to(
if it is attached to the global object(qconf -me global), it exits sytem wide, host object: 
only on that host (qconf -me NAME): cqueue object: only on that cqueue (qconf -mq NAME).
.sp1
When the user attached a resource attribute to an object, one also has to assign a value
to it; the resource limit. Another way to get a resource attribute value is done by 
configuring a load sensor for that attribute. 
.PP
.\"
.SS "\fBDefault queue resource attributes\fP"
In its default form it contains a selection of parameters in the
queue configuration as defined in
.M queue_conf 5 .
The queue configuration parameters being requestable for a job
by the user in principal are:
.sp 1
.nf
.RS
qname
hostname
notify
calendar
min_cpu_interval 
tmpdir
seq_no
s_rt
h_rt
s_cpu
h_cpu
s_data
h_data
s_stack
h_stack
s_core
h_core
s_rss
h_rss
.RE
.\"
.SS "\fBDefault host resource attributes\fP"
The standard set of host related attributes consists 
of two categories. he first category is built by several queue configuration
attributes which are particularly suitable to be managed on a host basis. These
attributes are:
.sp 1
.nf
.RS
slots
s_vmem
h_vmem
s_fsize
h_fsize
.RE
.fi
(please refer to
.M queue_conf 5
for details).
.sp 1
.B Note:
Defining these attributes in the
host complex is no contradiction to having them also in the queue
configuration. It allows maintaining the corresponding resources on a
host level and at the same time on a queue level. Total virtual free
memory (h_vmem) can be managed for a host, for example, and a subset
of the total amount can be associated with a queue on that host.
.sp 1
The second attribute category in the standard host complex are the default 
load values Every
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
periodically reports load to
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8 .
The reported load values are either the standard xxQS_NAMExx load values
such as the CPU load average (see
.M uptime 1 )
or load values defined by the xxQS_NAMExx administration (see the
.B load_sensor
parameter in the cluster configuration
.M xxqs_name_sxx_conf 5
and the
.I xxQS_NAMExx Installation and Administration Guide
for details).
The characteristics definition for the standard load values is part of
the default host complex, while administrator defined load values
require extension of the host complex. Please refer to the file
<xxqs_name_sxx_root>/doc/load_parameters.asc for detailed information on the
standard set of load values.
.\"
.SS "\fBOverriding attributes\fP"
One attribute can be assigned to the global object, host object, and queue object
at the same time. On the host level it might get its value from the user
defined resource limit and a load sensor. In case that the attribute is a consumable, 
we have in addition to the resource limit and its load report on host level also 
the internal usage, which the system keeps track of. The mergin is done as follows:
.sp 1
In general an attribute can be overridden on a lower level
   - global by hosts and queues
   - hosts by queues
and load values or resource limits on the same level.
.sp 1
We have one limitation for overriding attributes based on its relational 
operator:
.sp 1
!=, == operators can only be overridden on the same level, but not on a 
lower level. The user defined value always overrides the load value.
.sp 1   
>=, >, <=, < operators can only be overridden, when the new value is more 
restrictive than the old one.
.sp 1
In the case of a consumable on host level, which has also a load sensor, the
system checks for the current usage, and if the internal accouting is more 
restrictive than the load sensor report, the internal value is kept; if the
load sensour report is more restrictive, that one is kept.
.PP
.SH FORMAT
The principal format of a 
.I complex
configuration is that of a tabulated list. Each line starting with
a '#' character is a comment line. Each line despite comment lines
define one element of the complex. A element definition line
consists of the following 8 column entries per line (in the order
of appearance):
.SS "\fBname\fP"
The name of the complex element to be used to request this attribute
for a job in the
.M qsub 1
\fB\-l\fP option. An attribute
.B name
may appear only once across all 
complexes, i.e. the complex attribute definition is unique.
.SS "\fBshortcut\fP"
A shortcut for \fBname\fP which may also be used to request this
attribute for a job in the
.M qsub 1
\fB\-l\fP option. An attribute
.B shortcut
may appear only once across 
all complexes, so as to avoid the possibility of ambiguous complex attribute 
references.
.\"
.SS "\fBtype\fP"
This setting determines how the corresponding values are to be treated 
xxQS_NAMExx internally in case of comparisons or in case of load scaling for 
the load complex entries:
.IP "\(bu" 3n
With \fBINT\fP only raw integers are allowed.
.IP "\(bu" 3n
With \fBDOUBLE\fP floating point numbers in double precision (decimal and
scientific notation) can be specified.
.IP "\(bu" 3n
With \fBTIME\fP time specifiers are allowed. Refer to 
.M queue_conf 5  
for a format description.
.IP "\(bu" 3n
With \fBMEMORY\fP memory size specifiers are allowed. Refer to 
.M queue_conf 5 
for a format description.
.IP "\(bu" 3n
With \fBBOOL\fP the strings TRUE and FALSE are allowed. When used in a 
load formula (refer to 
.M sched_conf 5
)
TRUE and FALSE get mapped into '1' and '0'.
.IP "\(bu" 3n
With \fBSTRING\fP all strings are allowed and
.M strcmp 3
is used for comparisons.
.IP "\(bu" 3n
\fBCSTRING\fP is like \fBSTRING\fP except comparisons are case insensitive. 
.IP "\(bu" 3n
\fBRESTRING\fP is like \fBSTRING\fP with regular expression matching.
The syntax follows the following rules:
.sp 1
.nf
.RS
 - "*"   : matches any character and any number of chars 
           (between 0 and inv).
 - "?"   : matches any character. It cannot be no 
           character
 - "."   : is the character ".". It has no other meaning
 - "\\"   : escape character. "\\\\" = "\\", "\\*" = "*", 
           "\\?" = "?"
 - "[xx]": specifies an array or a range of allowed 
           characters for one character at a specific 
           position
 - "|"   : logical "or". Can only be used on the highest 
           level and cannot be escaped.

Examples:
 -l arch="*linux|solaris*"  : 
      results in "arch=linux" OR "arch=glinux" 
         OR "arch=alinus" OR "arch=solaris" OR
         "arch=solaris64" OR "arch=solaris86" OR ...
 -l arch="[linux|solaris]"  : 
      results in "arch=[linux" OR "arch=solaris]"  
.RE
.fi
                               
.IP "\(bu" 3n
\fBHOST\fP is like \fBCSTRING\fP but the string must be a valid hostname.   
.\"
.SS "\fBrelop\fP"
The
.B relation operator.
The relation operator is used when the value requested by the user for
this parameter is compared against the corresponding value configured for
the considered queues. If the result of the comparison is false, the
job cannot run in this queue. Possible relation operators are "==", "<",
">", "<=" and ">=". The only valid operator for string type attributes
is "==".
.\"
.SS "\fBrequestable\fP"
The entry can be used in a
.M qsub 1
resource request if this field is set to 'y' or 'yes'.
If set to 'n' or 'no' this entry cannot be used by a
user in order to request a queue or a class of queues.
If the entry is set to 'forced' or 'f' the 
attribute has to be requested by a job or it is rejected.
.sp
To enable resource request enforcement the existance of the
resource has to be defined. This can be done on a cluster global, per host
and per queue basis. The definition of resource availability is performed 
with the complex_values entry in
.M host_conf 5
and
.M queu_conf 5 .
.\"
.SS "\fBconsumable\fP"
The
.B consumable
parameter can be set to either 'yes' ('y' abbreviated) or 'no' 
('n'). It can be set to 'yes' only for numeric attributes (INT, DOUBLE, MEMORY,
TIME - see
.B type
above). If set to 'yes' the 
consumption of the corresponding resource can be managed by 
xxQS_NAMExx internal bookkeeping. In this case xxQS_NAMExx accounts 
for the consumption of this resource for all running jobs and ensures that jobs 
are only dispatched if the xxQS_NAMExx internal bookkeeping indicates 
enough available consumable resources. Consumables are an efficient means to 
manage limited resources such a available memory, free space on a file 
system, network bandwidth or floating software licenses.
.sp 1
Consumables can be combined with default or user defined load parameters 
(see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_conf 5
and
.M host_conf 5 ),
i.e. load values can be reported 
for consumable attributes or the consumable flag can be set for load 
attributes. The xxQS_NAMExx consumable resource management takes both 
the load (measuring availability of the resource) and the internal bookkeeping 
into account in this case, and makes sure that neither of both exceeds a given 
limit.
.sp 1
To enable consumable resource management the basic availability of a 
resource has to be defined. This can be done on a cluster global, per host and 
per queue basis while these categories may supersede each other in the given 
order (i.e. a host can restrict availability of a cluster resource and a
queue can restrict host and cluster resources). The definition of resource
availability is performed with the
.B complex_values
entry in
.M host_conf 5
and
.M queue_conf 5 . 
The
.B complex_values
definition of the "global" host specifies cluster global 
consumable settings. To each consumable complex attribute in a 
.B complex_values
list a value is assigned which denotes the maximum 
available amount for that resource. The internal bookkeeping will subtract 
from this total the assumed resource consumption by all running jobs as 
expressed through the jobs' resource requests.
.sp 1
.B Note:
Jobs can be forced to request a resource and thus to specify their 
assumed consumption via the 'force' value of the
.B requestable 
parameter (see above).
.sp 1
.B Note also:
A default resource consumption value can be pre-defined by the 
administrator for consumable attributes not explicitly requested by 
the job (see the
.B default
parameter below). This is meaningful only if 
requesting the attribute is not enforced as explained above.
.sp 1
See the
.I xxQS_NAMExx Installation and Administration Guide
for examples 
on the usage of the consumable resources facility.
.\"
.SS "\fBdefault\fP"
Meaningful only for consumable complex attributes (see
.B consumable
parameter above). xxQS_NAMExx assumes the resource amount denoted in the 
.B default
parameter implicitly to be consumed by jobs being dispatched to a 
host or queue managing the consumable attribute. Jobs explicitly requesting 
the attribute via the \fI\-l\fP option to
.M qsub 1
override this default value.
.\"
.SS "\fBurgency\fP"
This parameter has a meaning only in a xxQS_NAME_EExx system. 
.sp 1
The urgency value allows influencing
job priorities on a per resource base. The urgency value effects
the addend for each resource when determining the resource request 
related urgency contribution. For numeric type resource requests the 
addend is the product of the urgency value, the jobs assumed slot 
allocation and the per slot request as specified via \fI\-l\fP option to 
.M qsub 1 .
For string type requests the resources urgency value is directly 
used as addend. Urgency values are of type real. See under 
.M sge_priority 5 
for an overview on job priorities.
