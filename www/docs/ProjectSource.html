<span class="PlainText">
<p>
It's a good idea to browse a project's source repository first to learn how the files are organized. CVS refers to the top-level groupings of files as "modules" (rather than "directories").
<p>
      <ol>
       <li>From your Project Home page, click on Source in the Project Resources toolbar.
      <p>
       <li>Click on "Browse project source files" to access the project's source repository through CVSWeb.
	  </ol>
<p>
Each project's web content files are located in the "www/" module by default. Other project source modules are created and organized by each project owner or project members with CVS write permissions. If browsing deleted and removed project files is permitted, an "Attic/" module is displayed.

<a name="getsource"></a><span class="InputHeader">Getting your working copy of project source files</span>
<p>
To obtain (or &quot;check out&quot) your own working copy of project files, step-by-step instructions are included on the <a href="/templates/org/tigris/helm/project/Project Source.wm">Project Source page</a> for both command line CVS and WinCvs. These instructions also show the exact cvsroot to set for the current project. The <i>cvsroot</i> points to the server location of the project's source repository.
<p>
A <i>working copy</i> refers to the replicated set of project source files you maintain and modify on your own local machine. If you are new to CVS, this is an important CVS concept to understand. These files reside in your workspace, and the CVS server does not track or know anything about your changes (or other developers' changes) until you commit modified files or add newly created files back into the main project repository. 
<p>
This may be different from other versioning systems which explicitly track creation of workspaces. With CVS, you can check out working copies as many times as necessary. Keep in mind, however, that files in the project repository continually change over time as to reflect other developer contributions as the project progresses. It's critical to keep your working copies of files up to date with the repository.
