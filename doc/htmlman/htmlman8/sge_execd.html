NAME
     sge_execd - Grid Engine job execution agent

SYNOPSIS
     sge_execd [ -help ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> controls the  Grid  Engine  queues  local  to  the
     machine  on which <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> is running and executes/controls
     the jobs sent from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> to be run on these queues.

OPTIONS
  -help
     Prints a listing of all options.

LOAD SENSORS
     If a load sensor is configured for <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> via either  the
     global  or the execution host specific cluster configuration
     (See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.), the executable path of the  load  sensor
     is  invoked by <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> on a regular basis and delivers one
     or multiple load figures for the execution host (e.g.  users
     currently logged in) or the complete cluster (e.g. free disk
     space on a network wide scratch file system). The load  sen-
     sor  may  be a script or a binary executable. In either case
     its handling of the STDIN and STDOUT streams and its control
     flow must comply to the following rules:

     The load sensor has to be written as an infinite loop  wait-
     ing  at  a certain point for input from STDIN. If the string
     "quit" is read from STDIN,  the  load  sensor  should  exit.
     When an end-of-line is read from STDIN a load data retrieval
     cycle should start. The load sensor then  performs  whatever
     operation  is necessary to compute the desired load figures.
     At the end of the cycle the load sensor writes the result to
     stdout. The format is as follows:

     <B>o</B>  A load value report starts with a line containing nothing
        but the word  "start".

     <B>o</B>  Individual load values are separated by newlines.

     <B>o</B>  Each load value report consists of three parts  separated
        by colons (":") and containing no blanks.

     <B>o</B>  The first part of a load value information is either  the
        name  of  the host for which load is reported or the spe-
        cial name "global".

     <B>o</B>  The second part is the symbolic name of the load value as
        defined  in  the  host  or  global complex list (see <I>com-</I>
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html">plex(5)</A></B> for details). If a load  value  is  reported  for
        which no entry in the host or global complex list exists,
        the reported load value is not used.

     <B>o</B>  The third part is the measured load value.

     <B>o</B>  A load value report ends with a line with the word "end".

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

     SGE_EXECD_PORT If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_execd" instead to define that port.

RESTRICTIONS
     <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> usually is started from root on  each  machine  in
     the  Grid Engine pool.  If started by a normal user, a spool
     directory must be used to  which  the  user  has  read/write
     access.  In this case only jobs being submitted by that same
     user are handled correctly by the system.
