NAME
     accounting - Grid Engine accounting file format

DESCRIPTION
     An accounting record is written to the Grid Engine  account-
     ing  file  for each job having finished. The accounting file
     is processed by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qacct.html">qacct(1)</A></B> to derive accounting statistics.

FORMAT
     Each job is represented by a line in  the  accounting  file.
     Empty  lines  and  lines which contain one character or less
     are ignored.  Accounting record  entries  are  separated  by
     colon  (':')  signs.  The  entries  denote in their order of
     appearance:

     qname
          Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

     hostname
          Name of the execution host.

     group
          The effective group id of the job owner when  executing
          the job.

     owner
          Owner of the Grid Engine job.

     job_name
          Job name.

     job_number
          Job identifier - job number.

     account
          An account  string  as  specified  by  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  or
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> -A option.

     priority
          Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the
          priority  parameter  in  the  queue  configuration (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

     submission_time
          Submission time in seconds (since epoch format).

     start_time
          Start time in seconds (since epoch format).

     end_time
          End time in seconds (since epoch format).

     failed
          Indicates the problem which  occurred  in  case  a  job
          could  not  be  started  on  the  execution  host (e.g.
          because the owner of the  job  did  not  have  a  valid
          account on that machine). If Grid Engine tries to start
          a job multiple times, this may lead to multiple entries
          in  the  accounting  file corresponding to the same job
          ID.

     exit_status
          Exit status of the job script (or Grid Engine  specific
          status in case of certain error conditions).

     ru_wallclock
          Difference between end_time and start_time (see above).

     The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents
     of  the  standard  UNIX  rusage  structure  as  described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/getrusage.html">getrusage(2)</A></B>.  Depending on the operating system  where  the
     job was executed some of the fields may be 0.  The following
     entries are provided:

          ru_utime
          ru_stime
          ru_maxrss
          ru_ixrss
          ru_ismrss
          ru_idrss
          ru_isrss
          ru_minflt
          ru_majflt
          ru_nswap
          ru_inblock
