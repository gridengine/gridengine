/*
   THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE BOUNDARIES HEADER FILE

	There are different 'name intervals' reserved for special internal
	structs (lists).
	The LOWERBOUND & UPPERBOUND values restrict the namespaces to a defined 
	number of maximal fields.
	The user is offered 'user ?? areas'. One restriction to be maintained is
	that the maximum UPPERBOUND is smaller than the MAXINT value.
	Basic unit is only for easier extension used. If it is changed one has
	to recompile all clients. The compatibility is no longer kept.
