<P>The <B>Project Members</B> page lists all project members by name and their roles within that project. Following the associated <I>View Issues</I> links displays a listing of all project issues assigned to project members. Each project is configured differently; depending on a particular project's configuration, you can:

<UL>
<LI>View project issues assigned to yourself and to other members.
<LI>Request a new project role.
</UL>
<P>
Requests for new roles must be approved at the discretion of the Project Owner. The nature of your participation in any project is predicated upon these roles. If you have any questions about a role assignment, you should contact the Project Owner directly. Your ability to conduct various project activities is governed by certain permissions associated with different roles. To learn about the meaning of any role, please see our documentation on <A HREF="ProjectRoles.html">project roles.</A>
