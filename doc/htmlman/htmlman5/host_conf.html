NAME
     host_conf - Grid Engine execution  host  configuration  file
     format

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Host</I>_<I>conf</I> reflects the format of the template file  for  the
     execution  host  configuration.  Via the -ae and -me options
     of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> command, you can  add  execution  hosts  and
     modify  the configuration of any execution host in the clus-
     ter. Default execution host entries are added  automatically
     as  soon  as  a <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> registers to <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> for
     the very first time from a certain host. The  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  -sel
     switch can be used to display a list of execution host being
     currently configured in your Grid Engine system. Via the -se
     option  you  can print the execution host configuration of a
     specified host.

     The special hostname "global" can be used to define  cluster
     global characteristics.

FORMAT
     The format of a <I>host</I>_<I>conf</I> file is defined as follows:

     hostname
          The name of the execution host.

     load_scaling
          A comma separated list of scaling values to be  applied
          to  each  or  part of the load values being reported by
          the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the host and being defined  in  the
          cluster  global  "host"  complex (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  The
          load scaling factors are intended to level hardware  or
          operating system specific differences between execution
          hosts.  If,  for  example,  the  load   average   value
          (load_avg in the "host" complex; see also <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/uptime.html">uptime(1)</A></B>) of
          a multiprocessor machine is to be compared with a  sin-
          gle  processor machine the load as reported by the sin-
          gle CPU host needs to be weighted up against  the  mul-
          tiprocessor  load  (given  the same CPU hardware) to be
          comparable. The load scaling factors are integers being
          multiplied with the reported load quantities to consti-
          tute weighted load values. Thus, following the  example
          given  above,  the  load  value of the single processor
          machine needs to be multiplied by the number of proces-
          sors  of the single processor machine to become compar-
          able.

          The syntax of a load factor specification  is  as  fol-
          lows:  First  the name of the load value (as defined in
          the "host" complex) is given and, separated by an equal
          sign, the load scaling value is provided. No blanks are
          allowed in between the load_scaling value string.
          The parameter load_scaling is not  meaningful  for  the
          definition of the "global" host.

     complex_list
          The comma separated list of administrator defined  com-
          plexes  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>  for details) to be associated
          with the host. Only complex attributes contained in the
          enlisted  complexes  and  those  from  the "global" and
          "host" complex, which are implicitly attached  to  each
          host,  can be used in the complex_values list below. In
          case of the "global" host, the "host"  complex  is  not
          attached  and  only  "global"  complex  attributes  are
          allowed per default in the complex_values list  of  the
          "global" host.

          The default value for this parameter is NONE,  i.e.  no
          administrator defined complexes are associated with the
          host.

     complex_values
          complex_values defines quotas for  resource  attributes
          managed  via  this host. Each complex attribute is fol-
          lowed by an "=" sign and the value  specification  com-
          pliant  with  the  complex  attribute  type  (see  <I>com-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html">plex(5)</A></B>).  Quota specifications are separated  by  com-
          mas.  Only  attributes  as defined in complex_list (see
          above) may be used.

          The quotas are related to the resource  consumption  of
          all  jobs on a host in the case of consumable resources
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for details on consumable resources) or
          they  are  interpreted  on  a per job slot basis in the
          case of non-consumable resources.  Consumable  resource
          attributes  are  commonly  used  to manage free memory,
          free disk space or available floating software licenses
          while non-consumable attributes usually define distinc-
          tive characteristics like type of hardware installed.

          For  consumable  resource   attributes   an   available
          resource   amount  is  determined  by  subtracting  the
          current resource consumption of all running jobs on the
          host  from  the  quota in the complex_values list. Jobs
          can only  be  dispatched  to  a  host  if  no  resource
          requests exceed any corresponding resource availability
          obtained by this scheme. The quota  definition  in  the
          complex_values  list  is  automatically replaced by the
          current load value reported for this attribute, if load
          is monitored for this resource and if the reported load
          value is more stringent than  the  quota.  This  effec-
          tively avoids oversubscription of resources.

          Note: Load values replacing  the  quota  specifications
          may  have  become more stringent because they have been
          scaled (see load_scaling above)  and/or  load  adjusted
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).  The -<I>F</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> and the
          load  display  in  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B>  queue  control  dialog
          (activated  by  clicking  on  a  queue  icon  while the
          "Shift" key is pressed) provide detailed information on
          the  actual availability of consumable resources and on
          the origin of the values taken into account currently.

          Note also: The resource  consumption  of  running  jobs
          (used  for the availability calculation) as well as the
          resource requests of the jobs waiting to be  dispatched
          either  may be derived from explicit user requests dur-
          ing job submission (see the -<I>l</I> option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>)  or
          from  a  "default" value configured for an attribute by
          the administrator (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  The -<I>r</I>  option  to
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>  can be used for retrieving full detail on the
          actual resource requests of all jobs in the system.

          For non-consumable resources Grid  Engine  simply  com-
          pares the job's attribute requests with the correspond-
          ing specification in complex_values taking the relation
          operator  of  the  complex  attribute  definition  into
          account (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  If the result  of  the  com-
          parison  is  "true",  the  host is suitable for the job
          with respect to the particular attribute. For  parallel
          jobs each job slot to be occupied by a parallel task is
          meant to provide the same resource attribute value.

          Note: Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as
          consumable  resources  and hence non-numeric attributes
          are always handled on a per job slot basis.

          The default value for this parameter is NONE,  i.e.  no
          administrator  defined  resource  attribute  quotas are
          associated with the host.

     load_values
          This entry cannot be configured but is  only  displayed
          in  case of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> -se command. All load values are
          displayed as reported by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the  host.
          The load values are enlisted in a comma separated list.
          Each load value start with its  name,  followed  by  an
          equal sign and the reported value.

     processors
          This entry cannot be configured but is  only  displayed
          in  case  of  a  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> -se command. Its value is the
          number  of  processors  which  has  been  detected   by
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the corresponding host.

     usage_scaling
          This entry is only present in a Grid Engine  Enterprise
          Edition system. It is not available in Grid Engine.

          The format is equivalent to load_scaling  (see  above),
          the  only valid attributes to be scaled however are cpu
          for CPU time consumption, mem  for  Memory  consumption
          aggregated  over  the life-time of jobs and io for data
          transferred via any I/O devices. The default NONE means
          "no scaling", i.e. all scaling factors are 1.

     resource_capability_factor
          This entry is only present in a Grid Engine  Enterprise
          Edition system. It is not available in Grid Engine.

          The resource capability factor is used by  Grid  Engine
          Enterprise  Edition  when  assigning  jobs to execution
          hosts. The resource capability factor tells Grid Engine
          Enterprise Edition how the resources (CPU, memory, I/O,
          etc.) of one execution host compare to the resources of
          other  execution hosts. This helps to ensure that a job
          requiring a large percentage of resources (i.e. lots of
          tickets)  gets placed on an execution host containing a
          large percentage of the available resources.  The  load
          situation  on the execution hosts is taken into account
          in addition, to guarantee that  the  selected  host  is
          both powerful enough and lightly loaded.

          For example, you might consider setting  your  resource
          capability factors for each execution host based on the
          number of CPUs, the speed of the CPUs and the installed
          main memory:

             #_of_CPUs * (MHz/200) + GB_of_memory

          This would give an execution host with 32 200 MHz  CPUs
          and 10 gigabytes of memory a resource capability factor
          of 42, while an execution host with 24 200 MHz CPUs and
          40  gigabytes of memory would get a resource capability
          factor of 64, i.e. memory has a significant  impact  in
          this example.

          Other factors that you might want to consider  in  set-
          ting the resource capability factor are:

             job mix              - CPU or memory bound jobs
             CPU benchmarks       - comparison by CPU vendor
             megaflops (MFLOPS)   - for number crunching
             I/O capabilities     - disk/network speed
             available disk space - at the execution host

          The resource capability factor is stored as a  floating
          point  double  value.  The  range of values used is not
          important. Grid Engine Enterprise Edition only looks at
          the relation between values of different hosts.

     user_lists
          The user_lists parameter  contains  a  comma  separated
          list  of  so  called  user access lists as described in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained in at least one of
          the  enlisted  access  lists has access to the host. If
          the user_lists parameter is set to NONE  (the  default)
          any  user  has access being not explicitly excluded via
          the xuser_lists parameter described below.  If  a  user
          is  contained  both  in  an  access  list  enlisted  in
          xuser_lists and user_lists the user is denied access to
          the host.

     xuser_lists
          The xuser_lists parameter contains  a  comma  separated
          list  of  so  called  user access lists as described in
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained in at least one of
          the  enlisted access lists is not allowed to access the
          host. If the xuser_lists parameter is set to NONE  (the
          default)  any  user has access.  If a user is contained
          both in an access  list  enlisted  in  xuser_lists  and
          user_lists the user is denied access to the host.

     projects
          The projects parameter contains a comma separated  list
          of  projects that have access to the host. Any projects
          not in this list are denied access to the host. If  set
          to  NONE  (the default), any project has access that is
          not specifically excluded via the  xprojects  parameter
          described  below.  If a project is in both the projects
          and xprojects parameters, the project is denied  access
          to  the  host.   This  parameter is only available in a
          Grid Engine Enterprise Edition system.

     xprojects
          The xprojects parameter contains a comma separated list
          of  projects that are denied access to the host. If set
          to NONE (the default), no projects  are  denied  access
          other  than  those  denied access based on the projects
          parameter described above.  If a project is in both the
          projects  and  xprojects  parameters,  the  project  is
          denied access to the  host.   This  parameter  is  only
          available in a Grid Engine Enterprise Edition system.
