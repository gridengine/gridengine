                              system_tests/clients/qconf:
                              - message parsing for long host names was wrong
                              - check did not re-add the execd on failure
                              - check did unset the SGE_SINGLE_LINE environment variable

                              - procedure removed "=" from cluster queue instances:
                                e.g.: "fangorn=test2=4" was modified to
                                      "fangorn=test2 4"
                              - procedure saved host specific entries without 
                                resolving the names  

DT-2005-04-29-0: Testsuite: o Added junit test for issue 1595
