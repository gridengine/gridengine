.SH NAME
xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd \- xxQS_NAMExx single job controlling agent
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd
provides the parent process functionality for a single xxQS_NAMExx job.
The parent functionality is necessary on UNIX systems to retrieve
resource usage information (see
.M getrusage 2 )
after a job has finished. In addition, the
.I xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd
forwards signals to the job, such as the signals for suspension,
enabling, termination and the xxQS_NAMExx checkpointing signal (see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_ckpt 1
for details).
.PP
The
.I xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd
receives information about the job to start from the
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8 .
During the execution of the job it actually starts up to 3 child
processes. First a prolog script if this feature is enabled by
the \fBprolog\fP parameter in the cluster configuration
(see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_conf 5 ).
Second the job itself and third an epilog script if requested by
the \fBepilog\fP parameter in the cluster configuration. The prolog
and epilog scripts are to be provided by the xxQS_NAMExx administration
and are intended for site specific actions to be taken prior and
after execution of the actual user job. See
.M prolog 5
or
.M epilog 5
for detailed information.
.PP
After the job has finished and the epilog script is processed,
.I xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd
retrieves resource usage statistics about
the job, places them in a job specific subdirectory of the
spool directory of
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
for reporting through
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
and finishes.

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.I xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd
should not be invoked manually, but only by
