/*
 * This is the hard case.  Prior to Motif 1.2 the initial focus in
 * PromptDialogs goes to the default button, by default.  We really
 * want it on the text widget.  Hitting return still does the right
 * thing (activates the default button) even if we switch focus.
 *
 * The problem is that XmProcessTraversal doesn't work unless the dialog
 * already has the focus, and has done whatever it does when it gets the
 * focus.  Other problems are due to window managers: there is an
 * asyncronous delay between managing a dialog and when it pops up.  Also,
 * under twm, eg. dialogs don't automatically get focus like they do under
 * mwm.
 *
 * According to Kee Hinckley and the Motif FAQ list, the procedures
 * below will work.  They wait until the dialog gets the focus, and then
 * install a zero-length timer (which will be invoked sometime later, after
 * the dialog box has finished responding to the focus in event.  When the
 * timer goes off, things are stable enough that a call to XmProcessTraversal
 * should work.  It is gross, but that is why I'm putting it in a
 * convenence routine.
