.SH NAME
reporting \- xxQS_NAMExx reporting file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
A xxQS_NAMExx system writes a reporting file to 
$SGE_ROOT/default/common/reporting.
The reporting file contains data that can be used for accounting, monitoring and analysis purposes.
It contains information about the cluster (hosts, queues, load values, consumables, etc.), about the jobs running in the cluster and about sharetree configuration and usage.
All information is time related, events are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable interval.
It allows to monitor a "real time" status of the cluster as well as historical analysis.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
The reporting file is an ASCII file.
Eachline contains one record, the fields of a record are separated by a delimiter (:).
The reporting file contains records of different type. Each record type has a specific record structure. 
.PP
The first two fields are common to all reporting records:
.IP "\fBtime\fP"
Time (GMT unix timestamp) when the record was created.
.IP "\fBrecord type\fP"
Type of the accounting record.
The different types of records and their structure are described in the following text.
.SH new_job
The new_job record is written whenever a new job enters the system (usually by a submitting command). It has the following fields:
.IP "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Time when the job was submitted.
.IP "\fBjob_number\fP"
The job number.
.IP "\fBtask_number\fP"
The array task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records (as we don't have array tasks yet).
.IP "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.
.IP "\fBjob_name\fP"
The job name (from -N submission option)
.IP "\fBowner\fP"
The job owner.
.IP "\fBgroup\fP"
The unix group of the job owner.
.IP "\fBproject\fP"
The project the job is running in.
.IP "\fBdepartment\fP"
The department the job owner is in.
.IP "\fBaccount\fP"
The account string specified for the job (from -A submission option).
.IP "\fBpriority\fP"
The job priority (from -p submission option).
.SH job_log
The job_log record is written whenever a job, an array task or a pe tasks is changing status. A status change can be the transition from pending to running, but can also be triggered by user actions like suspension of a job.
It has the following fields:
.IP "\fBevent_time\fP"
Time (GMT unix time stamp) when the event was generated.
.IP "\fBevent\fP"
A one word description of the event.
.IP "\fBjob_number\fP"
The job number.
.IP "\fBtask_number\fP"
The array task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records (as we don't have array tasks yet).
.IP "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.
.IP "\fBstate\fP"
The state of the job after the event was processed.
.IP "\fBuser\fP"
The user who initiated the event (or special usernames "qmaster", "scheduler" 
and "execd" for actions of the system itself like scheduling jobs, executing jobs etc.).
.IP "\fBhost\fP"
The host from which the action was initiated (e.g. the submit host, the qmaster host, etc.).
.IP "\fBstate_time\fP"
Reserved field for later use.
.IP "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Time when the job was submitted.
.IP "\fBjob_name\fP"
The job name (from -N submission option)
.IP "\fBowner\fP"
The job owner.
.IP "\fBgroup\fP"
The unix group of the job owner.
.IP "\fBproject\fP"
The project the job is running in.
.IP "\fBdepartment\fP"
The department the job owner is in.
.IP "\fBaccount\fP"
The account string specified for the job (from -A submission option).
.IP "\fBpriority\fP"
The job priority (from -p submission option).
.IP "\fBmessage\fP"
A message describing the reported action.
.SH acct
Records of type acct are accounting records. They are written whenever a job, a task of an array job or the task of a parallel job terminates.
Accounting records comprise the following fields:
.IP "\fBqname\fP"
Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.
.IP "\fBhostname\fP"
Name of the execution host.
.IP "\fBgroup\fP"
The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.
.IP "\fBowner\fP"
Owner of the xxQS_NAMExx job.
.IP "\fBjob_name\fP"
Job name.
.IP "\fBjob_number\fP"
Job identifier - job number.
.IP "\fBaccount\fP"
An account string as specified by the
.M qsub 1
or
.M qalter 1
\fB\-A\fP option.
.IP "\fBpriority\fP"
Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the \fBpriority\fP
parameter in the queue configuration (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
.IP "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Submission time in seconds (since epoch format).
.IP "\fBstart_time\fP"
Start time in seconds (since epoch format).
.IP "\fBend_time\fP"
End time in seconds (since epoch format).
.IP "\fBfailed\fP"
Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started on 
the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a valid 
account on that machine). If xxQS_NAMExx tries to start a job multiple times, 
this may lead to multiple entries in the accounting file corresponding to 
the same job ID.
.IP "\fBexit_status\fP"
Exit status of the job script (or xxQS_NAMExx specific status in case
of certain error conditions).
.IP "\fBru_wallclock\fP"
Difference between \fBend_time\fP and \fBstart_time\fP (see above).
.PP
The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents of the
standard UNIX rusage structure as described in
.M getrusage 2 .

fields may be 0.  The following entries are provided:
