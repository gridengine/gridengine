NAME
     qdel - delete Grid Engine jobs from queues

SYNTAX
     qdel  [  -f  ]  [  -help   ]   [   -u   wc_user_list   ]   [
     wc_job_range_list ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qdel</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to  delete
     one  or more jobs. A manager/operator can delete jobs of any
     user while a user can only delete his own jobs. In case that
     a  manager wants to delete another users job, he can specify
     the job id. If the manager is using a job name  or  pattern,
     he  has also to specify the user name via "-u wc_user_list".
     A "qdel wc_job_name" deletes per default only  the  jobs  of
     the  calling  user.  <I>Qdel</I> deletes jobs in the order in which
     their job identifiers are presented. Find additional  infor-
     mation    concerning   <I>wc</I>_<I>user</I>_<I>list</I>   and   <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>list</I>   in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

OPTIONS
     -f   Force action for running jobs. The job(s)  are  deleted
          from the list of jobs registered at <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> even
          if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> controlling  the  job(s)  does  not
          respond to the delete request sent by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

     Users which are neither Grid Engine managers  nor  operators
     can only use the -f option (for their own jobs) if the clus-
     ter configuration entry  qmaster_params  contains  the  flag
     ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  However, behavior for
     administrative and non-administrative  users  differs.  Jobs
     are  deleted  from  the  Grid Engine database immediately in
     case of administrators. Otherwise,  a  regular  deletion  is
     attempted  first  and a forced cancellation is only executed
     if the regular deletion was unsuccessful.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -u wc_user_list
          Deletes only those jobs which were submitted  by  users
          specified in the list of usernames.  For managers it is
          possible to use qdel -u "*" to delete all jobs  of  all
          users. If a manager wants to delete a specific job of a
          user, he has to specify the user and the job. If no job
          is specified all jobs from that user are deleted.

     wc_job_range_list
          A list of jobs, which should be deleted

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>qdel</I> uses
                    (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>act</I>_<I>qmaster</I>
