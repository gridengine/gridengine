NAME
     qhost - show the status of Grid Engine hosts, queues, jobs

SYNTAX
     qhost [ -F [resource_name,...]  [ -help ] [ -h host_list ] [
     -j ] [ -l resource=val,... ] [ -u user,... ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>qhost</I> shows the current status of the available Grid  Engine
     hosts,  queues  and  the  jobs  associated  with the queues.
     Selection  options  allow  you  to  get  information   about
     specific  hosts,  queues, jobs or users.  Without any option
     <I>qhost</I> will display a list of all hosts without queue or  job
     information.

OPTIONS
     -F [ resource_name,... ]
          <I>qhost</I> will present a detailed listing  of  the  current
          resource  availability  per  host  with  respect to all
          resources (if the option argument is omitted)  or  with
          respect   to   those   resources   contained   in   the
          resource_name list. Please refer to the description  of
          the  Full  Format  in  section OUTPUT FORMATS below for
          further detail.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -h host_list
          Prints a list of all hosts contained in host_list.

     -j   Prints all jobs running on the  queues  hosted  by  the
          shown hosts. This switch calls -q implicitly.

     -l resource[=value],...
          Defines the resources required by the  hosts  on  which
          information  is  requested.   Matching  is performed on
          hosts.

     -q   Show  information  about  the  queues  hosted  by   the
          displayed hosts.

     -u user,...
          Display information only on those jobs and queues being
          associated with the users from the given user list.

OUTPUT FORMATS
     Depending on the presence or absence of the -q or -F and  -j
     option three output formats need to be differentiated.  PP

  Default Format (without -q, -F and -j)
     Following the header line a line is printed  for  each  host
     consisting of

     <B>o</B>  the Hostname

     <B>o</B>  the Architecture.

     <B>o</B>  the  Number of processors.

     <B>o</B>  the Load.

     <B>o</B>  the Total Memory.

     <B>o</B>  the Used Memory.

     <B>o</B>  the Total Swapspace.

     <B>o</B>  the Used Swapspace.

     If the -q option is supplied, each  host  status  line  also
     contains extra lines for every queue hosted by the host con-
     sisting of,

     <B>o</B>  the queue name.

     <B>o</B>  the  queue  type  -  one   of   B(atch),   I(nteractive),
        C(heckpointing),  P(arallel),  T(ransfer) or combinations
        thereof,

     <B>o</B>  the number of used and available job slots,

     <B>o</B>  the state  of  the  queue  -  one  of  u(nknown)  if  the
        corresponding  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> cannot be contacted, a(larm),
        A(larm),     C(alendar      suspended),      s(uspended),
        S(ubordinate),  d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror) or combi-
        nations thereof.

     If the state is a(alarm) at least one of the load thresholds
     defined  in the <I>load</I>_<I>thresholds</I> list of the queue configura-
     tion  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  is  currently  exceeded,   which
     prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue.

     As opposed to this, the  state  A(larm)  indicates  that  at
     least  one  of  the  suspend  thresholds  of  the queue (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) is currently exceeded. This  will  result  in
     jobs  running  in  that  queue  being successively suspended
     until no threshold is violated.

     The states s(uspended) and d(isabled)  can  be  assigned  to
     queues  and  released  via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command. Suspending a
     queue will cause all jobs executing  in  that  queue  to  be
     suspended.

     The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that
     the  queue  has been disabled or suspended automatically via
     the calendar facility of Grid Engine (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>),
     while  the S(ubordinate) state indicates, that the queue has
     been  suspend  via  subordination  to  another  queue   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details). When suspending a queue (regard-
     less of the cause) all jobs  executing  in  that  queue  are
     suspended too.

     If an E(rror) state is displayed for a  queue,  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     on  that  host was unable to locate the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> exe-
     cutable on that host in order to start a job.  Please  check
     the  error  logfile of that <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for leads on how to
     resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterwards  via
     the -c option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command manually.

     If the -F option was used, resource availability information
     is printed following the host status line. For each resource
     (as selected  in  an  option  argument  to  -F  or  for  all
     resources  if the option argument was omitted) a single line
     is displayed with the following format:

     <B>o</B>  a one letter specifier  indicating  whether  the  current
        resource availability value was dominated by either
        `g' - a cluster global,
        `h' - a host total or

     <B>o</B>  a second one letter specifier indicating the  source  for
        the current resource availability value, being one of
        `l' - a load value reported for the resource,
        `L' - a load value for the resource  after  administrator
        defined load scaling has been applied,
        `c' - availability derived from the consumable  resources
        facility (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complexes.html">complexes(5)</A></B>),
        `v' -  a  default  complexes  configuration  value  never
        overwritten by a load report or a consumable update or
        `f' - a fixed  availability  definition  derived  from  a
        non-consumable  complex  attribute  or  a  fixed resource
        limit.

     <B>o</B>  after a colon the name of the resource on which  informa-
        tion is displayed.

     <B>o</B>  after an equal sign  the  current  resource  availability
        value.

     The displayed availability values and the sources from which
     they  derive  are  always the minimum values of all possible
     combinations.  Hence,  for  example,  a  line  of  the  form
     "qf:h_vmem=4G"  indicates  that a queue currently has a max-
     imum availability in virtual memory  of  4  Gigabyte,  where
     this  value  is  a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in the
     queue configuration) and it is  queue  dominated,  i.e.  the
     host  in  total  may have more virtual memory available than
     this, but the queue doesn't allow  for  more.  Contrarily  a
     line  "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an upper bound of 4
     Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but the limit would be
     derived  from  a load value currently reported for the host.
     So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher  virtual
     memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue
     resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

     After the queue status line (in case of -j) a single line is
     printed  for  each job running currently in this queue. Each
     job status line contains

     <B>o</B>  the job ID,

     <B>o</B>  the job name,

     <B>o</B>  the job owner name,

     <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering),  r(unning),
        R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see
        the Reduced Format section for detailed information),

     <B>o</B>  the start date and time and the function of the job (MAS-
        TER or SLAVE - only meaningful in case of a parallel job)
        and

     <B>o</B>  the priority of the jobs.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Grid Engine cell <I>qstat</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine  communication  of  the  <I>qstat</I>  client
                    resides.  Per default the local host is used.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>act</I>_<I>qmaster</I>
                     Grid Engine master host file
