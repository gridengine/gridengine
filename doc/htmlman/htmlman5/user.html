NAME
     user - Grid Engine user entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A user entry is used to store ticket and  usage  information
     on  a per user basis. Maintaining user entries for all users
     participating in a Grid Engine system is  required  if  Grid
     Engine is operated under a user share tree policy.

     If the enforce_user cluster configuration parameter  is  set
     to  <I>auto</I>,  a  user  object  for  the submitting user will be
     created automatically during job submission, if one does not
     already   exist.  The  auto_user_oticket,  auto_user_fshare,
     auto_user_default_project, and auto_user_delete_time cluster
     configuration  parameters will be used as default attributes
     of the new user object.

     A list of currently configured user entries can be displayed
     via  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  -suserl  option.  The  contents  of each
     enlisted user entry can be shown via the -suser switch.  The
     output follows the <I>user</I> format description. New user entries
     can be created and existing can be modified via the  -auser,
     -muser and -duser options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.

FORMAT
     A user entry contains four parameters:

     name The user name.

     oticket
          The amount of override tickets  currently  assigned  to
          the user.

     fshare
          The current functional share of the user.

     default_project
          The default project of the user.

     delete_time
          The wall-clock time, expressed as the number of seconds
          elapsed  since  January 1, 1970, when this user will be
          deleted. If set to zero, this is a permanent  user.  If
          set  to  one,  the user currently has active jobs.  For
          additional  information  about  automatically   created
          users,  see  the enforce_user and auto_user_delete_time
          parameters in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.
