<p>The <b>Project Home</b> page for any particular project is the project's focal point with information that the project owner wishes to share with members and nonmembers alike. Because project home pages can be customized, these vary greatly, depending on the project owner's preferences. At a minimum, the owner should include content describing the nature and goals of the project. Interested users can also use the project's hyperlinks in the Project Resources tool bar above to learn more about the project, including subscribing to that project's mailing lists.</a> 
<p>
<p>If you have become a project member, you'll find that your project's home page looks pretty much the same as it does to other users, with the exception of additional links in the upper right-hand corner you can use to request a new project role.
<p>
You can learn more about project information and activities available to you now using the links below as you continue through the "Project resources for members" index.
