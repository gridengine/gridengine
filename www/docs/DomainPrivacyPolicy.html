      <UL>
        <li>A higher level of security than is possible with htaccess; 
        <li>Greater site functionality and customization; 
        <li>Performance gains from load-balancing and streamlined processing.

      <P>Collab.Net, Inc. decided to implement SSL security with a digital certificate for certain pages on this site dealing with sensitive information transfer. For example, we use SSL for the following pages:</P>
      <UL>
        <li>Login - to encrypt password information 
        <li>Registration/Account Maintenance - to protect contact information and password. 
      </UL>
      <P>Because of the significant performance penalties associated with encryption, Sourcecast does not currently encrypt other pages that do not warrant the same degree of security. Therefore, you will get an alert message when you move from secure to insecure pages while navigating this site.</P></TD>

      Collab.Net, Inc. uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology on Sourcecast. SSL establishes a secure connection between the user and the server and uses a private key to encrypt data that is transferred across this connection. In addition, the project administration tool available through Sourcecast allows project managers to grant specific permissions for individual users and developers.
