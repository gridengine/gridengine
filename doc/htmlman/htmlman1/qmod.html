NAME
     qmod - modify a Grid Engine queue

SYNTAX
     qmod [ options ] [ wc_job_range_list | wc_queue_list ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmod</I> enables users classified as <I>owners</I>  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>
     for  details)  of  a workstation to modify the state of Grid
     Engine queues for his/her machine as well as  the  state  of
     his/her  own  jobs.   A manager/operator or root can execute
     <I>qmod</I> for any queue and job in  a  cluster.  Find  additional
     information  concerning  <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I>  and  <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>list</I>  in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

OPTIONS
     -c   Clears   the   error    state    of    the    specified
          jobs(s)/queue(s).   Do not use this switch anymore, use
          -cj / -cq instead.

     -cj  Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).

     -cq  Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

     -d   Disables  the  queue(s),  i.e.  no  further  jobs   are
          dispatched  to  disabled queues while jobs already exe-
          cuting in these queues are allowed to finish.

     -e   Enables the queue(s).

     -f   Force the modification action for the queue despite the
          apparent  current  state of the queue. For example if a
          queue appears to be suspended  but  the  job  execution
          seems to be continuing the manager/operator can force a
          suspend operation which will  send  a  SIGSTOP  to  the
          jobs.  In any case, the queue or job status will be set
          even if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  controlling  the  queues/jobs
          cannot    be    reached.    Requires   manager/operator
          privileges.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -r   If applied to queues, reschedules  all  jobs  currently
          running  in  this  queue.   If applied to running jobs,
          reschedules  the  jobs.  Requires   root   or   manager
          privileges.  Do not use this switch anymore, use -rj /-
          rq instead.

     -rj  If applied  to  running  jobs,  reschedules  the  jobs.
          Requires root or manager privileges.

     -rq  If applied to queues, reschedules  all  jobs  currently
          running  in  this  queue.   Requires  root  or  manager
          privileges.

     -s   If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any  jobs
          which  might  be  active.  If  applied to running jobs,
          suspends the jobs. Do not use this switch anymore,  use
          -sj / -jq instead.

     -sj  If applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. If a job
          is  both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its
          queue, a following unsuspend  of  the  queue  will  not
          release the suspension state on the job.

     -sq  If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any  jobs
          which might be active.

     -us  If applied to queues, unsuspends  the  queues  and  any
          jobs  which  might  be  active.  If  applied  to  jobs,
          unsuspends the jobs. Do not use  this  switch  anymore,
          use -usj / -usq instead.

     -usj If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. If  a  job  is
          both  suspended  explicitly  and  via suspension of its
          queue, a following unsuspend  of  the  queue  will  not
          release the suspension state on the job.

     -usq If applied to queues, unsuspends  the  queues  and  any
          jobs which might be active.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>qmod</I> uses
                    (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                    If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map  entry  for the service
                    "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
