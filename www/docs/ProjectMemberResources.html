Development activity for projects hosted on this site is handled through an integrated set of tools. Project owners and members use these tools to communicate with each other and coordinate their work. The <b>Project Home</b> page serves as the project's focal point. The Project Resources tool bar appears on all project pages, providing links to hosted tools and specific project data including:
<ul>
<li>Developer participants and other project members
<li>Project announcements and news
<li>File downloads and project documents
<li>Mailing list subscriptions and access to list archives
<li>Source code browsing and repository access
<li>Issue (bug) querying and reporting.
</ul>
<p>
The help documents associated with each of these resources are generally addressed to project members, but non-member users also have read-only access to these same project resource screens for any hosted projects publicly listed on this site. These users cannot, however, modify files or contribute source code until being approved as members with specific project roles.
