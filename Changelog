DT-2003-11-28-0: Enhancem.: Made sge_gethostbyname() reentrant in four of the

                            I'll let AD do the fifth way: mutex locking.
                            I changed sge_getme() to use sge_gethostbyname()
                            and sge_gethostbyaddr().
                            I removed the misplaced daemons/shadowd/gethostbyname.*
                            files and replaced them with a sge_gethostbyname_retry()
                            function in sge_hostname.c.
                            I fixed a minor DRMAA bug when passing in a NULL
                            rusage pointer, and narrowed the scope of the event
                            client using SG's new interface.
                            I also fixed the build on HPUX-11.
                            I still need AD to add mutex locking to
                            sge_gethostbyname() default case and sge_gethostbyaddr().
                            I also need to apply platform specific gethostbyaddr_r()
                            synamtecs to sge_gethostbyaddr().
                 Changed:   sge_hostname.*, sge_prog.c, gethostbyname.*, aimk,
                            shadowd.c, DRMAA, and lots of Makefiles.

SG-2003-08-19-1: Bugfix:   - "Qstat -F complex_name" did not filter for the 
                             complex_name and displayed all complexes
                           - working on large job lists was very slow due to 
                             the hashing. This change was introduced in 
                             JG-2002-12-17-0 as an enhancement. The JG code 
                             is commented out and can be added again, when 
                             the hashing really improves the speed.
                           - Fixed bug: 586. All slots in a queue are used

                             used.
                           - changed the way "xxx2scheduler" functions generate 
                             their result list. They build a filter now to 
                             generate a list, which only contains the needed 
                             elements, instead of removing the unused ones in 
                             the end.
                           - devided the complex list for deciding if a job is 
                             suitable for a queue into two: a host complex list 
                             and a queue complex list.

                            during sge_language.c initialization.

                            delivering bug is fixed, the timeout and the sleep
