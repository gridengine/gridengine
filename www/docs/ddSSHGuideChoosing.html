<p><b>Platforms</b> 

<p><b>Linux, Unix, Solaris.</b> Linux supports SSH. To connect using SSH, see the "Tunneling Using Cygwin" section below. </p>

<p><b>Macintosh.</b> In important regards, procedures for tunneling with a Mac client terminal resemble those for Windows clients. Mac users can download and install any number of free or for-fee terminals, the most popular being <a href="http://www.macssh.com" target="_new">MacSSH,</a> which is characteristically easy to use, is free, and offers superior performance for SSH1 connections. <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/" target="_new">

<p>NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH</a>, a fast and easy-to-use telnet and SSH1 client is also free. It supports effortless scp (secure copying), as well. 

<p>Mac OS X, based on FreeBSD and the Mach 3 kernel, has SSH built in and is constantly updated. You can also obtain and use <a href="http://www.DataFellows.com" target="_new">Data Fellows' F-Secure SSH,</a> a for-fee (see below) client create a desktop terminal allowing you to tunnel to the CVS server. F-Secure SSH can be obtained at: http://www.DataFellows.com. For SSH1, you will want F-Secure SSH v.1.02; v.2.1 is for SSH2 connections only--i.e., those requiring encrypted certificates, or keys.</p>



<p><b>Windows</b>. If you are using Windows (NT or 9x or 2K), then you can use <a href="http://www.vandyke.com/" target="_new">SecureCRT</a>, <a href="http://www.DataFellows.com" target="_new">F-Secure SSH</a>, or <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_new">Cygwin</a>. Cygwin, from Cygnus Solutions, provides a nearly full Unix environment on your desktop. 

<p>In contrast, SecureCRT and F-Secure SSH only provide user-friendly terminals, i.e., they don't pretend to emulate a Unix environment. Both F-Secure SSH and SecureCRT cost money ($100 for SecureCRT, $150 for F-Secure SSH), although a free, 30-day trial version is available for each. Of all, Cygwin has the added value of not just being free and very powerful, but also open source and constantly improved upon. </p>
