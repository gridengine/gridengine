     <p>CVSWeb source code browsing allows the user to browse CVS
     managed files and their previous versions. Specifically, CVSWeb
     enables you to:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>Drill down through directories to get to individual source code files</li> 
      <li>List versions for each file with author name and change log comments</li>  
      <li>View any version of a source file</li> 
      <li>See color-coded the differences between any two versions of a file</li>  
      <li>See files annotated with the author of each section</li>
	  <li>View deleted and removed files (when permitted)
     </ul>

      <p>Access source code browsing by clicking the <i>Source Code</i>
      link in the Project menu within any project page. </p>

      <p>CVSWeb is a browser-based interface for CVS
      repositories. Browse the file hierarchy by selecting directories
      (designated with slashes after them, e.g. "www/"). When you
      click on a file, you can view the revision history for that
      file. Selecting a revision number downloads that revision of the
      file. Each revision includes a link to display differences
      between that revision and the previous one. A form at the bottom
      of the file revision history page allows you to display
      differences between arbitrary revisions.
