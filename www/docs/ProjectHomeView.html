The <b>Project Home</b> page for any particular project is the project's focal point with information that the project owner wishes to share with members and nonmembers alike. Because project home pages can be customized, these vary greatly, depending on the project owner's preferences. At a minimum, the owner should include content describing the nature and goals of the project. Interested users can also use the project's hyperlinks in the Project Resources tool bar above to learn more about the project, including subscribing to that project's mailing lists.
