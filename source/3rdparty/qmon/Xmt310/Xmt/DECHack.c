 * The procedures in this file are only needed with DECWindows Xt
 * libraries (VMS and Ultrix) to work around the fact that calling
 * XtRemoveCallback causes a core dump.
 * This is undeniably gross.
 * See also Xmt.h, where we #define XtAddCallback and XtRemoveCallback
 * to be these functions here.
 * 
 * Note that these are not fully general replacements for the real functions;
 * they don't work if a procedure is registered more than once, with
 * different data on the same list in the same widget.  But this doesn't
 * happen in the Xmt library.
