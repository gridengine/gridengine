NAME
     sge_conf - Grid Engine configuration files

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>conf</I> defines the global and local Grid Engine configura-
     tions  and  can  be  shown/modified  by  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  using the
     -sconf/-mconf options. Only root or the cluster  administra-
     tor may modify <I>sge</I>_<I>conf</I>.

     At its initial start-up, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> checks to see  if  a
     valid Grid Engine configuration is available at a well known
     location in the Grid Engine  internal  directory  hierarchy.
     If so, it loads that configuration information and proceeds.
     If not, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> writes a generic  configuration  con-
     taining  default  values  to  that  same location.  The Grid
     Engine execution daemons <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> upon start-up retrieve
     their configuration from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

     The  actual  configuration  for  both   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>   and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is a superposition of a so called <I>global</I> confi-
     guration and a <I>local</I> configuration being pertinent  for  the
     host  on  which  a master or execution daemon resides.  If a
     local configuration is available, its entries overwrite  the
     corresponding entries of the global configuration. Note: The
     local configuration does not have to contain all valid  con-
     figuration entries, but only those which need to be modified
     against the global entries.

FORMAT
     The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the
     individual parameters that compose the global and local con-
     figurations for a Grid Engine cluster:

execd_spool_dir
     The execution daemon spool directory path. Again, a feasible
     spool  directory  requires  read/write access permission for
     root. The entry in the global configuration for this parame-
     ter  can  be  overwritten by execution host local configura-
     tions, i.e. each  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  may  have  a  private  spool
     directory  with  a different path, in which case it needs to
     provide read/write permission for the root  account  of  the
     corresponding execution host only.

     Under execd_spool_dir a directory named corresponding to the
     unqualified  hostname  of  the  execution host is opened and
     contains all information spooled to disk. Thus, it is possi-
     ble  for the execd_spool_dirs of all execution hosts to phy-
     sically reference the same directory path (the  root  access
     restrictions mentioned above need to be met, however).

     Being a parameter set at installation time changing the glo-
     bal execd_spool_dir in a running system is not supported.
     The default location for the execution daemon  spool  direc-
     tory is &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/spool.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

mailer
     mailer is the  absolute  pathname  to  the  electronic  mail
     delivery  agent on your system. It must accept the following
     syntax:

          mailer -s &lt;subject-of-mail-message&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a  private  mail  agent.  Changing
     mailer will take immediate effect.

     The default for mailer depends on the  operating  system  of
     the  host  on  which the Grid Engine master installation was
     run. Common values are /bin/mail or /usr/bin/Mail.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

xterm
     xterm is the absolute pathname to the X Window System termi-
     nal emulator, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a  private  mail  agent.  Changing
     xterm will take immediate effect.

     The default for xterm is /usr/bin/X11/xterm.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

load_sensor
     A comma separated list of executable shell script  paths  or
     programs  to  be  started  by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> and to be used in
     order to retrieve site configurable load  information  (e.g.
     free space on a certain disk partition).

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a set of private load_sensor  pro-
     grams  or  scripts.  Changing  load_sensor  will take effect
     after two load report intervalls (see  load_report_time).  A
     load  sensor  will  be  restarted  automatically if the file
     modification time of the load sensor executable changes.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     In addition to the load sensors configured via  load_sensor,
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_exec.html">sge_exec(8)</A></B>   searches   for   an   executable   file  named
     <I>qloadsensor</I> in  the  execution  host's  Grid  Engine  binary
     directory path.  If such a file is found, it is treated like
     the configurable load sensors defined in  load_sensor.  This
     facility  is intended for pre-installing a default load sen-
     sor.

prolog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started before
     execution of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment set-
     ting as that for the Grid Engine jobs to be  started  after-
     wards.  An  optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
     which this procedure is to be started. The procedures  stan-
     dard  output  and the error output stream are written to the
     same file used also for the standard output and error output
     of  each job.  This procedure is intended as a means for the
     Grid Engine administrator to automate the execution of  gen-
     eral  site  specific tasks like the preparation of temporary
     file systems with the need for the same context  information
     as  the  job.   Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a private prologue
     script. Correspondingly, the execution host local configura-
     tions  is can be overwritten by the queue configuration (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> ). Changing prolog will take immediate effect.

     The default for prolog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents from execution of a prologue script.

     The following special variables being  expanded  at  runtime
     can  be  used  (besides  any  other strings which have to be
     interpreted by the procedure) to constitute a command line:

     $<I>host</I>
          The name of the host on which the prolog or epilog pro-
          cedures are started.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>owner</I>
          The user name of the job owner.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>
          Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>name</I>
          The name of the job.

     $<I>processors</I>
          The processors string as contained in the queue  confi-
          guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) of the master queue (the
          queue in which the prolog  and  epilog  procedures  are
          started).

     $<I>queue</I>
          The cluster queue name of the  master  queue  instance,
          i.e.  the  cluster queue in which the prolog and epilog
          procedures are started.

     $<I>stdin</I>_<I>path</I>
          The  pathname  of  the  stdin  file.  This  is   always
          /dev/null  for prolog, pe_start, pe_stop and epilog. In
          the job script it is the pathname of the stdin file for
          the  job.  When delegated file staging is enabled, this
          path is set to $fs_stdin_tmp_path. When delegated  file
          staging  is not enabled, it is the stdin pathname given
          via DRMAA or qsub.

     $<I>stdout</I>_<I>path</I>

     $<I>stderr</I>_<I>path</I>
          The pathname of the  stdout/stderr  file.  This  always
          points  to  the  output/error file. When delegated file
          staging   is   enabled,   this   path   is    set    to
          $fs_stdout_tmp_path/$fs_stderr_tmp_path. When delegated
          file staging is not enabled, it  is  the  stdout/stderr
          pathname given via DRMAA or qsub.

     $<I>merge</I>_<I>stderr</I>
          If merging of stderr and stdout is requested, this flag
          is "1", otherwise it is "0".  If this flag is 1, stdout
          and stderr are merged in one  file,  the  stdout  file.
          Merging  of  stderr and stdout can be requested via the
          DRMAA job template  attribute  'drmaa_join_files'  (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_attributes.html">drmaa_attributes(3)</A></B> ) or the qsub parameter '-j y' (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> ).

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>host</I>
          When delegated file staging is requested for the  stdin
          file, this is the name of the host where the stdin file
          has to be copied from before the job is started.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>host</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>host</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdout/stderr  file, this is the name of the host where
          the stdout/stderr file has to be copied  to  after  the
          job has run.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>path</I>
          When delgated file staging is requested for  the  stdin
          file,  this  is  the  pathname of the stdin file on the
          host $fs_stdin_host.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>path</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>path</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdout/stderr   file,  this  is  the  pathname  of  the
          stdout/stderr       file       on       the        host
          $fs_stdout_host/$fs_stderr_host.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>tmp</I>_<I>path</I>
          When delegated file staging is requested for the  stdin
          file,  this  is  the  destination pathname of the stdin
          file on the execution host. The prolog script must copy
          the  stdin  file  from $fs_stdin_host:$fs_stdin_path to
          localhost:$fs_stdin_tmp_path  to  establish   delegated
          file staging of the stdin file.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>tmp</I>_<I>path</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>tmp</I>_<I>path</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdout/stderr  file, this is the source pathname of the
          stdout/stderr file on the execution  host.  The  epilog
          script    must    copy    the    stdout    file    from
          localhost:$fs_stdout_tmp_path                        to
          $fs_stdout_host:$fs_stdout_path  (the  stderr file from
          localhost:$fs_stderr_tmp_path                        to
          $fs_stderr_host:$fs_stderr_path) to establish delegated
          file staging of the stdout/stderr file.

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdin</I>_<I>file</I>_<I>staging</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stdout</I>_<I>file</I>_<I>staging</I>

     $<I>fs</I>_<I>stderr</I>_<I>file</I>_<I>staging</I>
          When  delegated  file  staging  is  requested  for  the
          stdin/stdout/stderr  file, the flag is set to "1", oth-
          erwise it is set to "0" (see in  delegated_file_staging
          how to enable delegated file staging).

          These three flags correspond to the DRMAA job  template
          attribute          'drmaa_transfer_files'          (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_attributes.html">drmaa_attributes(3)</A></B> ).

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

epilog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started  after
     execution of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment set-
     ting as that for the Grid Engine jobs  that  has  just  com-
     pleted.  An optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
     which this procedure is to be started. The procedures  stan-
     dard  output  and the error output stream are written to the
     same file used also for the standard output and error output
     of  each job.  This procedure is intended as a means for the
     Grid Engine  administrator  to  automate  the  execution  of
     general  site  specific  tasks  like the cleaning up of tem-
     porary file systems with  the  need  for  the  same  context
     information as the job.  Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a private
     epilogue script. Correspondingly, the execution  host  local
     configurations is can be overwritten by the queue configura-
     tion  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>  ).   Changing  epilog  will  take
     immediate effect.

     The default for epilog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents  from  execution  of  a epilogue script.  The  same
     special variables as for prolog can be used to constitute  a
     command line.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

shell_start_mode
     This parameter defines the  mechanisms  which  are  used  to
     actually  invoke the job scripts on the execution hosts. The
     following values are recognized:

     <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>
          If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interac-
          tively  by  invoking  it  just with the script name the
          operating system's executable loader uses the  informa-
          tion  provided in a comment such as `#!/bin/csh' in the
          first line of the script to detect which command inter-
          preter to start to interpret the script. This mechanism
          is  used  by  Grid  Engine  when   starting   jobs   if
          <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I> is defined as shell_start_mode.

     <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>
          POSIX does not consider first script line comments such
          a `#!/bin/csh' as being significant. The POSIX standard
          for batch queuing systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires
          a  compliant queuing system to ignore such lines but to
          use user specified or configured default command inter-
          preters  instead.  Thus,  if shell_start_mode is set to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> Grid Engine will either use the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).

     <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>
          Setting  the  shell_start_mode  parameter   either   to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  or  <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>  requires you to set
          the umask in use for <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every  user
          has  read  access  to  the active_jobs directory in the
          spool directory of the corresponding execution  daemon.
          In  case you have prolog and epilog scripts configured,
          they also need to be readable by any user who may  exe-
          cute jobs.
          If this violates your site's security policies you  may
          want to set shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>. This
          will force Grid Engine to open the job script  as  well
          as  the  epilogue and prologue scripts for reading into
          STDIN as root (if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  was  started  as  root)
          before  changing  to the job owner's user account.  The
          script is then fed into the STDIN stream of the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).
          Thus setting shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> also
          implies  <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  behavior. Note, however, that
          feeding scripts into the  STDIN  stream  of  a  command
          interpreter  may  cause trouble if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B>
          are invoked inside a job script as  they  also  process
          the  STDIN  stream  of  the  command interpreter. These
          problems can usually be  resolved  by  redirecting  the
          STDIN  channel of those commands to come from /dev/null
          (e.g. rsh host date &lt; /dev/null). Note also,  that  any
          command-line options associated with the job are passed
          to the executing shell. The  shell  will  only  forward
          them  to  the  job  if they are not recognized as valid
          shell options.

     Changes to shell_start_mode will take immediate effect.  The
     default for shell_start_mode is <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

login_shells
     UNIX command interpreters like the Bourne-Shell (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B>)
     or  the  C-Shell  (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>) can be used by Grid Engine to
     start job scripts. The command interpreters  can  either  be
     started  as  login-shells  (i.e. all system and user default
     resource files like .login or .profile will be executed when
     the  command  interpreter is started and the environment for
     the job will be set up as if the user has just logged in) or
     just   for  command  execution  (i.e.  only  shell  specific
     resource files like .cshrc will be executed  and  a  minimal
     default environment is set up by Grid Engine - see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).
     The parameter login_shells contains a comma  separated  list
     of  the  executable  names of the command interpreters to be
     started as login-shells.   Shells  in  this  list  are  only
     started  as  login  shells if the parameter shell_start_mode
     (see above) is set to <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.

     Changes to login_shells will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for login_shells is sh,csh,tcsh,ksh.


     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

min_uid
     min_uid places a lower bound on user IDs that  may  use  the
     cluster. Users whose user ID (as returned by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is
     less than min_uid will not be allowed to  run  jobs  on  the
     cluster.

     Changes to min_uid will take immediate effect.  The  default
     for min_uid is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

min_gid
     This parameter sets the lower bound on group  IDs  that  may
     use  the cluster.  Users whose default group ID (as returned
     by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is less than min_gid will not be allowed  to
     run jobs on the cluster.

     Changes to min_gid will take immediate effect.  The  default
     for min_gid is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

user_lists
     The user_lists parameter contains a comma separated list  of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists has access to the cluster. If the user_lists parameter
     is set to NONE (the default) any user has access  being  not
     explicitly  excluded via the xuser_lists parameter described
     below.  If a user  is  contained  both  in  an  access  list
     enlisted  in  xuser_lists  and user_lists the user is denied
     access to the cluster.

     Changes to user_lists will take immediate effect

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

xuser_lists
     The xuser_lists parameter contains a comma separated list of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists  is  denied  access to the cluster. If the xuser_lists
     parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has  access.
     If  a  user  is contained both in an access list enlisted in
     xuser_lists and user_lists (see above) the  user  is  denied
     access to the cluster.

     Changes to xuser_lists will take immediate effect

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

administrator_mail
     administrator_mail specifies a comma separated list  of  the
     electronic  mail address(es) of the cluster administrator(s)
     to whom internally-generated problem reports are  sent.  The
     mail  address  format depends on your electronic mail system
     and how it is configured; consult your  system's  configura-
     tion guide for more information.

     Changing administrator_mail  takes  immediate  effect.   The
     default for administrator_mail is an empty mail list.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

projects
     The projects list contains all projects  which  are  granted
     access  to Grid Engine. User belonging to none of these pro-
     jects cannot use Grid Engine. If users belong to projects in
     the  projects  list and the xprojects list (see below), they
     also cannot use the system.

     Changing projects takes immediate effect.  The  default  for
     projects is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

xprojects
     The xprojects list contains all projects which  are  granted
     access  to  Grid Engine. User belonging to one of these pro-
     jects cannot use Grid Engine. If users belong to projects in
     the  projects  list (see above) and the xprojects list, they
     also cannot use the system.

     Changing xprojects takes immediate effect.  The default  for
     xprojects is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not   be   overwritten   by   the   execution   host   local
     configuration.

load_report_time
     System load is reported periodically by the  execution  dae-
     mons  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.   The  parameter  load_report_time
     defines the time interval between load reports.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use  a  different  load  report  time.
     Changing load_report_time will take immediate effect.

     Note: Be careful when modifying load_report_time.  Reporting
     load too frequently might block <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> especially if
     the number of execution hosts is large. Moreover, since  the
     system load typically increases and decreases smoothly, fre-
     quent load reports hardly offer any benefit.

     The default for load_report_time is 40 seconds.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

reschedule_unknown
     Determines whether  jobs  on  hosts  in  unknown  state  are
     rescheduled   and  thus  sent  to  other  hosts.  Hosts  are
     registered as unknown if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_master.html">sge_master(8)</A></B> cannot establish con-
     tact  to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on those hosts (see max_unheard ).
     Likely reasons are a breakdown of the host or a breakdown of
     the network connection in between, but also <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may
     not be executing on such hosts.

     In any case, Grid Engine can reschedule jobs running on such
     hosts  to  another  system.  reschedule_unknown controls the
     time which Grid Engine will wait before jobs are rescheduled
     after  a  host became unknown. The time format specification
     is hh:mm:ss. If the special value 00:00:00 is set, then jobs
     will not be rescheduled from this host.

     Rescheduling is only initiated for jobs which have activated
     the rerun flag (see the -r y option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the rerun
     option  of   <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).    Parallel   jobs   are   only
     rescheduled  if the host on which their master task executes
     is  in  unknown  state.  Checkpointing  jobs  will  only  be
     rescheduled when the when option of the corresponding check-
     pointing environment containes  an  appropriate  flag.  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>).   Interactive  jobs  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html">qsh(1)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>,
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>) are not rescheduled.

     The default for reschedule_unknown id 00:00:00

     The global configuration entry for this value  may  be  over
     written by the execution host local configuration.

max_unheard
     If <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> could not contact or was not contacted  by
     the  execution daemon of a host for max_unheard seconds, all
     queues residing on that particular host are  set  to  status
     unknown.   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>,  at least, should be contacted by
     the execution daemons in order  to  get  the  load  reports.
     Thus,    max_unheard    should    by    greater   than   the
     load_report_time (see above).

     Changing max_unheard takes immediate  effect.   The  default
     for max_unheard is 2 minutes 30 seconds.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

loglevel
     This parameter specifies  the  level  of  detail  that  Grid
     Engine components such as <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> use
     to produce informative, warning or error messages which  are
     logged  to  the  <I>messages</I>  files in the master and execution
     daemon  spool  directories  (see  the  description  of   the
     execd_spool_dir parameter above). The following message lev-
     els are available:

     <I>log</I>_<I>err</I>
          All error events being recognized are logged.

     <I>log</I>_<I>warning</I>
          All error events  being  recognized  and  all  detected
          signs of potentially erroneous behavior are logged.

     <I>log</I>_<I>info</I>
          All error events being recognized, all  detected  signs
          of  potentially  erroneous  behavior  and  a variety of
          informative messages are logged.

     Changing loglevel will take immediate effect.

     The default for loglevel is <I>log</I>_<I>info</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_aj_instances
     This parameter defines the maximum amount of array  task  to
     be  scheduled  to  run  simultaneously  per  array  job.  An
     instance of an array task will be created within the  master
     daemeon  when  it gets a start order from the scheduler. The
     instance will be destroyed when  the  array  task  finishes.
     Thus  the  parameter provides control mainly over the memory
     consumption of array jobs in the master and  scheduler  dae-
     mon.  It  is  most  useful  for very large clusters and very
     large array jobs.  The default for this parameter  is  2000.
     The  value  0  will deactivate this limit and will allow the
     scheduler to start as  many  array  job  tasks  as  suitable
     resources are available in the cluster.

     Changing max_aj_instances will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_aj_tasks
     This parameter defines the maximum number of array job tasks
     within  an  array job.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> will reject all array
     job submissions which request more than  max_aj_tasks  array
     job  tasks.  The  default  for  this parameter is 75000. The
     value 0 will deactivate this limit.

     Changing max_aj_tasks will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_u_jobs
     The number of active (not finished)  jobs  which  each  Grid
     Engine  user  can  have in the system simultaneously is con-
     trolled by this parameter. A value greater  than  0  defines
     the  limit.  The  default  value 0 means "unlimited". If the
     max_u_jobs limit is exceeded by a job  submission  then  the
     submission   command  exits  with  exit  status  25  and  an
     appropriate error message.

     Changing max_u_jobs will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_jobs
     The number of  active  (not  finished)  jobs  simultaneously
     allowed  in Grid Engine.  is controlled by this parameter. A
     value greater than 0 defines the limit. The default value  0
     means  "unlimited".  If  the max_jobs limit is exceeded by a
     job submission then the submission command exits  with  exit
     status 25 and an appropriate error message.

     Changing max_jobs will take immediate effect.


     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

enforce_project
     If set to <I>true</I>, users are  required  to  request  a  project
     whenever  submitting a job. See the -P option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> for
     details.

     Changing enforce_project will take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for enforce_project is <I>false</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

enforce_user
     If set to <I>true</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> must exist to allow for  job  sub-
     mission. Jobs are rejected if no corresponding user exists.

     If set to <I>auto</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> object  for  the  submitting  user
     will  automatically be created during job submission, if one
     does   not    already    exist.    The    auto_user_oticket,
     auto_user_fshare,       auto_user_default_project,       and
     auto_user_delete_time configuration parameters will be  used
     as default attributes of the new <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> object.

     Changing  enforce_user  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for enforce_user is <I>false</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

auto_user_oticket
     The number of override tickets to  assign  to  automatically
     created  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects. User objects are created automati-
     cally if the enforce_user attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

     Changing auto_user_oticket will  affect  any  newly  created
     user  objects,  but  will not change user objects created in
     the past.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

auto_user_fshare
     The number of functional shares to assign  to  automatically
     created  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects. User objects are created automati-
     cally if the enforce_user attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

     Changing auto_user_fshare will affect any newly created user
     objects,  but  will  not  change user objects created in the
     past.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

auto_user_default_project
     The default  project  to  assign  to  automatically  created
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>  objects.  User objects are created automatically if
     the enforce_user attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

     Changing auto_user_default_project  will  affect  any  newly
     created  user  objects,  but  will  not  change user objects
     created in the past.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

auto_user_delete_time
     The number of seconds of inactivity  after  which  automati-
     cally  created <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects will be deleted. User objects
     are created automatically if the enforce_user  attribute  is
     set  to  <I>auto</I>. If the user has no active or pending jobs for
     the specified amount of time, the object will  automatically
     be  deleted.   A value of 0 can be used to indicate that the
     automatically created user object is  permanent  and  should
     not be automatically deleted.

     Changing auto_user_delete_time will affect the deletion time
     for all users with active jobs.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

set_token_cmd
     This parameter is only present if your Grid Engine system is
     licensed to support AFS.

     Set_token_cmd points to a command which sets and extends AFS
     tokens for Grid Engine jobs. In the standard Grid Engine AFS
     distribution, it is supplied as a script which  expects  two
     command  line  parameters.  It  reads  the token from STDIN,
     extends the token's expiration time and sets the token:

          &lt;set_token_cmd&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;token_extend_after_seconds&gt;

     As a shell script this command will call the programs:

          - SetToken
          - forge

     which are provided by your distributor as source  code.  The
     script looks as follows:

          --------------------------------
          #!/bin/sh
          # set_token_cmd
          forge -u $1 -t $2 | SetToken
          --------------------------------

     Since it is necessary for  <I>forge</I>  to  read  the  secret  AFS
     server  key,  a site might wish to replace the set_token_cmd
     script by a command, which connects to a self written daemon
     at  the  AFS  server.  The  token  must be forged at the AFS
     server and returned to the local machine, where <I>SetToken</I>  is
     executed.

     Changing set_token_cmd  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for set_token_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

pag_cmd
     This parameter is only present if your Grid Engine system is
     licensed to support AFS.

     The path to your <I>pagsh</I> is specified via this parameter.  The
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  process  and the job run in a <I>pagsh</I>. Please
     ask your AFS administrator for details.

     Changing pag_cmd will take immediate  effect.   The  default
     for pag_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

token_extend_time
     This parameter is only present if your Grid Engine system is
     licensed to support AFS.

     the time  period  for  which  AFS  tokens  are  periodically
     extended.  Grid  Engine  will  call  the  token extension 30
     minutes before the tokens expire until  jobs  have  finished
     and the corresponding tokens are no longer required.

     Changing token_extend_time will take immediate effect.   The
     default for token_extend_time is 24:0:0, i.e. 24 hours.


     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

gid_range
     The gid_range is a comma separated list of range expressions
     of  the  form  n-m  (n  as  well  as m being integer numbers
     greater than 99), where m is an abbreviation for m-m.  These
     numbers  are  used  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  to  identify processes
     belonging to the same job.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a separate set up  group  ids  for
     this  purpose.   All number in the group id range have to be
     unused supplementary group ids  on  the  system,  where  the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is started.

     Changing gid_range will take immediate effect.  There is  no
     default for gid_range. The administrator will have to assign
     a value for gid_range during installation of Grid Engine.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

qmaster_params
     A list of additional parameters can be passed  to  the  Grid
     Engine qmaster. The following values are recognized:

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>FORCED</I>_<I>QDEL</I>
          If this parameter is set, non-administrative users  can
          foce  deletion  of  their own jobs via the -<I>f</I> option of
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.  Without this parameter,  forced  deletion  of
          jobs  is  only  allowed  by  the Grid Engine manager or
          operator.

          Note: Forced deletion for jobs is executed  differently
          depending  on whether users are Grid Engine administra-
          tors or not. In case of administrative users, the  jobs
          are  removed  from the internal database of Grid Engine
          immediately. For regular users,  the  equivalent  of  a
          normal  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>  is  executed  first,  and  deletion is
          forced only if the normal cancellation  was  unsuccess-
          ful.

     <I>FORBID</I>_<I>RESCHEDULE</I>
          If this parameter is set, re-queuing of jobs cannot  be
          initiated  by  the job script which is under control of
          the user. Without this  parameter  jobs  returning  the
          value 99 are rescheduled. This can be used to cause the
          job  to  be  restarted  at  a  different  machine,  for
          instance  if  there  are  not  enough  resources on the
          current one.


     <I>FORBID</I>_<I>APPERROR</I>
          If this parameter is set, the  application  cannot  set
          itself  to  error  state.   Without this parameter jobs
          returning the value 100 are set  to  error  state  (and
          therefore  can  be manually rescheduled by clearing the
          error state).  This can be used to set the job to error
          state  when  a starting condition of the application is
          not fulfilled before the application  itself  has  been
          started, or when a clean up procedure (e.g. in the epi-
          log) decides that it  is  neccessary  to  run  the  job
          again,  by  returning  100 in the prolog, pe_start, job
          script, pe_stop or epilog script.

     <I>DISABLE</I>_<I>AUTO</I>_<I>RESCHEDULING</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", the <I>reschedule</I>_<I>unknown</I> parame-
          ter is not taken into account.

     <I>MAX</I>_<I>DYN</I>_<I>EC</I>
          Sets the max number of dynamic event clients  (as  used
          by  qsub  -sync  y and by Grid Engine DRMAA API library
          sessions). The default is set  to  99.  The  number  of
          dynamic event clients should not be bigger than half of
          the number of file  descriptors  the  system  has.  The
          number of file descriptors are shared among the connec-
          tions to all exec hosts, all event  clients,  and  file
          handles that the qmaster needs.

     Changing qmaster_params will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for qmaster_params is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

execd_params
     This is foreseen for passing additional  parameters  to  the
     Grid  Engine  execution  daemon.  The  following  values are
     recognized:

     <I>ACCT</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, for reserved usage is
          used for the accounting entries cpu, mem and io instead
          of the measured usage.

     <I>KEEP</I>_<I>ACTIVE</I>
          This value should only be set for  debugging  purposes.
          If  set  to  true, the execution daemon will not remove
          the spool directory maintained by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> for a
          job.

     <I>PTF</I>_<I>MIN</I>_<I>PRIORITY</I>, <I>PTF</I>_<I>MAX</I>_<I>PRIORITY</I>
          The maximum/minumum priority  which  Grid  Engine  will
          assign  to a job.  Typically this is a negative/postive
          value in the range of -20 (maximum) to 19 (minimum) for
          systems  which  allow  setting  of  priorties  with the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html">nice(2)</A></B> system call. Other  systems  may  provide  dif-
          ferent ranges.
          The default priority range (varies from system to  sys-
          tem)  is installed either by removing the parameters or
          by setting a value of -999.
          See the "messages" file of the execution daemon for the
          predefined  default value on your hosts. The values are
          logged during the startup of the execution daemon.

     <I>NOTIFY</I>_<I>KILL</I>
          The parameter allows you  to  change  the  notification
          signal  for  the  signal SIGKILL (see -<I>notify</I> option of
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The parameter either  accepts  signal  names
          (use  the  -<I>l</I>  option  of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) or the special value
          <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no notification  signal  will  be
          sent.  If  it  is set to <I>TERM</I>, for instance, or another
          signal name then this signal will be sent as  notifica-
          tion signal.

     <I>NOTIFY</I>_<I>SUSP</I>
          With this parameter it is possible to modify the notif-
          ication  signal  for  the  signal  SIGSTOP (see -<I>notify</I>
          parameter of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The  parameter  either  accepts
          signal names (use the -<I>l</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) or the spe-
          cial value <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no notification signal
          will  be  sent.  If it is set to <I>TSTP</I>, for instance, or
          another signal name then this signal will  be  sent  as
          notification signal.

     <I>SHARETREE</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>
          If this parameter is set to  true,  reserved  usage  is
          taken  for  the  Grid  Engine  share  tree  consumption
          instead of measured usage.

     Changing  execd_params  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for execd_params is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     <I>USE</I>_<I>QSUB</I>_<I>GID</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the primary group  id
          being  active  when  a job was submitted will be set to
          become the primary group id for job execution.  If  the
          parameter  is  not set, the primary group id as defined
          for the job owner in the execution host <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/passwd.html">passwd(5)</A></B>  file
          is used.
          The feature is only available for  jobs  submitted  via
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.  Also, it only
          works for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> jobs (and thus also for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>  and
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>) if rsh and rshd components are used which are
          provided with Grid Engine  (i.e.,  the  rsh_daemon  and
          rsh_command  parameters  may  not  be  changed from the
          default).

reporting_params
     Used to define the behaviour of  reporting  modules  in  the
     Grid  Engine  qmaster. Changes to the reporting_params takes
     immediate effect.  The following values are recognized:

     <I>accounting</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the  accounting  file
          is  written.   The  accounting  file is prerequisit for
          using the qacct command.

     <I>reporting</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the reporting file is
          written.   The reporting file contains data that can be
          used for monitoring and analysis, like job  accounting,
          job  log,  host  load and consumables, queue status and
          consumables  and  sharetree  configuration  and  usage.
          Attention:  Depending on the size and load of the clus-
          ter, the reporting file can become  quite  large.  Only
          activate  the reporting file if you have a process run-
          ning that will consume the reporting file!  See <I>report-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/ing.html">ing(5)</A></B>  for  further  information about format and con-
          tents of the reporting file.

     <I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>
          Contents of the accounting and the reporting  file  are
          buffered  in  the  Grid Engine qmaster and flushed in a
          fixed interval.  This interval can be  configured  with
          the  <I>flush</I>_<I>time</I>  parameter.   It  is  specified as time
          value in the format HH:MM:SS.   Sensible  values  range
          from some seconds to one minute. Setting it too low may
          slow down qmaster, setting it too high will make  qmas-
          ter consume high amounts of memory for buffering data.

     <I>joblog</I>
          If this parameter is set to true,  the  reporting  file
          will  contain job logging information. See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html">reporting(5)</A></B>
          for more information about job logging.

     <I>sharelog</I>
          The Grid Engine  qmaster  can  dump  information  about
          sharetree  configuration and use to the reporting file.
          The parameter <I>sharelog</I> sets an interval in which share-
          tree information will be dumped.  It is set in the for-
          mat HH:MM:SS. A value of  00:00:00  configures  qmaster
          not to dump sharetree information. Intervals of several
          minutes up  to  hours  are  sensible  values  for  this
          parameter.   See  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html">reporting(5)</A></B>  for further information
          about sharelog.

finished_jobs
     Grid Engine stores a certain number of <I>just</I> <I>finished</I> jobs to
     provide  post  mortem  status information. The finished_jobs
     parameter defines the number of finshed jobs  being  stored.
     If  this  maximum  number is reached, the eldest finshed job
     will be discarded for every  new  job  being  added  to  the
     finshed job list.

     Changing finished_jobs  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for finished_jobs is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

qlogin_daemon
     This parameter  specifies  the  executable  that  is  to  be
     started  on  the server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B> request. Usually
     this is the fully qualified pathname of the system's  telnet
     daemon. If no value is given, a specialized Grid Engine com-
     ponent is used.

     Changing qlogin_daemon  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for qlogin_daemon is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

qlogin_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B>  request.   Usually  this  is  the fully qualified
     pathname of the systems's telnet client program. If no value
     is given, a specialized Grid Engine component is used. It is
     automatically started with the target host and  port  number
     as parameters.

     Changing qlogin_command will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for qlogin_command is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rlogin_daemon
     This parameter  specifies  the  executable  that  is  to  be
     started  on  the  server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> request without a
     command argument to be executed remotely.  Usually  this  is
     the  fully qualified pathname of the system's rlogin daemon.
     If no value is given, a specialized Grid Engine component is
     used.
     Changing  rlogin_daemon  will  take  immediate  effect.  The
     default for rlogin_daemon is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rlogin_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>  request  without  a command argument to be executed
     remotely. Usually this is the fully  qualified  pathname  of
     the  system's rlogin client program. If no value is given, a
     specialized Grid Engine component is used.  The  command  is
     automatically  started  with the target host and port number
     as parameters like required for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B>.  The Grid  Engine
     rlogin  client  has  been extened to accept and use the port
     number argument. You can only  use  clients,  such  as  <I>ssh</I>,
     which also understand this syntax.

     Changing rlogin_command  will  take  immediate  effect.  The
     default for rlogin_command is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rsh_daemon
     This parameter  specifies  the  executable  that  is  to  be
     started  on the server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> request with a com-
     mand argument to be executed remotely.  Usually this is  the
     fully  qualified  pathname of the system's rsh daemon. If no
     value is given, a specialized Grid Engine component is used.

     Changing rsh_daemon will take immediate effect. The  default
     for rsh_daemon is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rsh_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>  request  with  a  command  argument  to be executed
     remotely. Usually this is the fully  qualified  pathname  of
     the  system's  rsh  client  program. If no value is given, a
     specialized Grid Engine component is used.  The  command  is
     automatically  started  with the target host and port number
     as parameters like required for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B> plus  the  command
     with  its arguments to be executed remotely. The Grid Engine
     rsh client has been extened  to  accept  and  use  the  port
     number  argument.  You  can  only  use clients, such as <I>ssh</I>,
     which also understand this syntax.

     Changing rsh_command will take immediate effect. The default
     for rsh_command is none.
     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

delegated_file_staging
     This flag must be set to "true" when the prolog  and  epilog
     are  ready  for  delegated  file  staging, so that the DRMAA
     attribute 'drmaa_transfer_files' is supported. To  establish
     delegated  file  staging,  use  the variables beginning with
     "$fs_..." in prolog and epilog to move the input, output and
     error  files  from one host to the other.  When this flag is
     set to "false", no file staging is available for  the  DRMAA
     interface.  File  staging  is currently implemented only via
     the DRMAA interface.  When an error occurs while moving  the
     input, output and error files, return error code 100 so that
     the error handling mechanism can handle the error correctly.
