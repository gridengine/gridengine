NAME
     project - Grid Engine Enterprise Edition project entry  file
     format

DESCRIPTION
     The project object is only  available  in  case  of  a  Grid
     Engine Enterprise Edition system. Grid Engine has no project
     object.

     Jobs can be submitted to projects in Grid Engine  Enterprise
     Edition  and  a project can be assigned with a certain level
     of importance via the functional  or  the  override  policy.
     This  level of importance is then inherited by the jobs exe-
     cuting under that project.

     A list of currently configured projects can be displayed via
     the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  -sprjl  option. The contents of each enlisted
     project definition can be shown via the  -sprj  switch.  The
     output  follows the <I>project</I> format description. New projects
     can be created and existing can be modified via  the  -aprj,
     -mprj and -dprj options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.
