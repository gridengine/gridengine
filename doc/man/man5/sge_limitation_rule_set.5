.SH DESCRIPTION
Limitation rule sets (lrs) are a flexible way to set a maximum resource consumption for any job requests. They are used by the scheduler to select the next possible jobs for running.
The job request distinction is done by a set of user, project, cluster queue, host and pe filter criteria.
.PP
By using the limitation rule sets admistrators are allowed to define a fine granular resource quota
configuration. This helps restricting some job requests to a lesser resource usage and granting
other job requests a higher resource usage.
.PP
A list of currently configured lrs can be displayed via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-slrsl\fP option. The contents of each listed lrs definition
can be shown via the \fB\-slrs\fP switch. The output follows the
.I  xxQS_NAME_Sxx_limitation_rule_set
format description. New lrs can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-alrs\fP, \fB\-mlrs\fP and \fB\-dlrs\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
.PP
A limitation rule set defines a maximum resource quota for a particular job request. All of the
configured rule sets apply all of the time. This means that if multiple rule sets are defined, the
most restrictive set is used.
.PP
Every limitation rule set consist of one or more limitation rules. These rules are evaluated
in order, and the first rule that matches a specific request will be used. A rule set always
results in at most one effective limitation rule for a specific request.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
A limitation rule set definition contains the following parameters:
.SS "\fBname\fP"
The limitation rule set name.
.SS "\fBenabled\fP"
If set to \fItrue\fB the limitation rule set is active and will be considered
for scheduling decisions. The default value is \fItrue\fP.
.SS "\fBdescription\fP"
This description field is optional and can be set to arbitrary string. The
default value is \fINONE\fP.
.SS "\fBlimit\fP"
Every limitation rule set needs at least one limitation rule definition started by
the limit field. It's possible to define more limitation rules divided by a new line.
A limitation rule consists of an optional name, the filters for a specific job
request and the resource quota limit.
.PP
By default, the expressed limit counts for the entire filter scope. To express a
filter-scope-specific limit, it's possible to define an expanded list by quoting the scope
list with the '\'' sign. It's only possible to set one complete filter in an expanded list.
.\"
The tags for expressing a limitation rule are:
.IP "name"
The name of the rule. The use is optional. The rule name must be unique in one
rule set.
.IP "users"
Contains a comma separated list of UNIX users or ACLs (see
.M access_list 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs by a user in the list or one of the ACLs
in the list. Any user not in the list will not be considered for the limitation
rule. The default value is '*', which means any user. An ACL is differentiated
from a UNIX user name by prefixing the ACL name with an '@' sign. To exclude a
user or ACL from the rule, the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign. Defined
UNIX user or ACL names need not be known in the xxQS_NAMExx configuration.
.IP "projects"
Contains a comma separated list of projects (see
.M project 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs requesting a project in the list. Any
project not in the list will not be considered for the limitation rule. If no
project filter is specified, all projects and jobs with no requested project
match the rule. The value '*' means all jobs with requested projects. To
exclude a project from the rule, the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign.
The value '!*' means only jobs with no project requested.
.IP "pes"
Contains a comma separated list of PEs (see
.M sge_pe 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs requesting a pe in the list. Any PE not in
the list will not be considered for the limitation rule. If no pe filter is
specified, all pe and jobs with no requested pe matches the rule. The value '*'
means all jobs with requested pe. To exclude a pe from the rule, the name can
be prefixed with the '!' sign. The value '!*' means only jobs with no pe
requested.
.IP "queues"
Contains a comma separated list of cluster queues (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs that may be scheduled in a queue in the list.
Any queue not in the list will not be considered for the limitation rule. The
default value is '*', which means any queue. To exclude a queue from the rule,
the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign.
.IP "hosts"
Contains a comma separated list of host or hostgroups (see
.M host 5
and
.M hostgroup 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs that may be scheduled in a host in the list or a
host contained in a hostgroup in the list. Any host not in the list will not be considered
for the limitation rule. The default value is '*', which means any hosts. To
exclude a host or hostgroup from the rule, the name can be prefixed with the
'!' sign.
.IP "to"
This mandatory field defines the quota for resource attributes for this rule. The quota
is expressed by one or more limit definitions separated by commas. The
configuration allows two kind of limits definitions
.RS
.IP "static limits"
Static limits sets static values as quotas. Each limits consists of a complex
attribute followed by an "=" sign and the value specification compliant with
the complex attribute type (see
.M complex 5 ).
.IP "dynamic limits"
A dynamic limit is a simple algebraic expression used to derive the limit
value. To be dynamic, the formula can reference a complex attribute whose
value is used for the calculation of the resulting limit.
The formula expression syntax is that of
a sum of weighted complex values, that is:
.sp 1
.nf
.RS
$complex1[*w1][{+|-}$complex2[*w2][{+|-}...]]
.RE
.fi
.sp 1
The weighting factors (w1, ...) are positive integers. 
The complex values (complex1, ...)
are specified by the name defined as type INT or DOUBLE in the complex list
(see
.M complex 5 ).
.br
.B Note:
Dynamic limits can only configured for a host-specific rule.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following is the simplest form of a limitation rule set. It restricts all
users together to the maximal use of 100 slots in the whole cluster.
.nf

=======================================================================
{
   name         max_u_slots
   description  "All users max use of 100 slots"
   enabled      true
   limit        to slots=100
}
=======================================================================

.fi
.sp 1
The next example restricts user1 and user2 to 6g virtual_free
and all other users to the maximal use of 4g virtual_free on
every host in hostgroup lx_hosts.
.nf

=======================================================================
{
   name         max_virtual_free_on_lx_hosts
   description  "Rule set for virtual_free restriction"
   enabled      true
   limit        users `user1,user2` hosts `@lx_host` to virtual_free=6g
   limit        users `*` hosts `@lx_host` to virtual_free=4g
}
=======================================================================

.fi
.sp 1
The next example shows the use of a dynamic limit. It restricts
all users together to a maximum use of the double size of num_proc.
.nf

=======================================================================
{
   name         max_slots_on_every_host
   enabled      true
   limit        hosts `*` to slots=$num_proc*2
}
=======================================================================
