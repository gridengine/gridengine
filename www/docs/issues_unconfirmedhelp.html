<P>[This document is aimed primarily at people who may have used
IssueZilla before the <span class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span>
state was implemented. It might be helpful for newer users as well.]

<P>

New issues in some products will now show up in a new state, <span
class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span>.  This means that nobody has
confirmed that the issue is real. Very busy developers generally
ignore <span class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span> that have been
assigned to them, until they have been confirmed in one way or
another.  (Developers with more time will hopefully glance over their
<span class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span> issues regularly.)

<P>

There are two basic ways that an issue can become confirmed (and thus
enter the <span class="TypewriterBold">NEW</span>) state.

<UL>

  <LI> A user with the appropriate permissions (see below for more on
       permissions) decides that the issue is a valid one, and confirms
       it.
<P>

  <LI> The issue gathers a certain number of votes. <B>Any</B> valid
  IssueZilla user may vote for issues (each user gets a certain number
  of issues); any <span class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span>
  issue which gets enough votes becomes automatically confirmed, and
  enters the <span class="TypewriterBold">NEW</span> state.

</UL>

That's why it is worthwhile to search the issue database for
duplicates of your issue to vote on them <B><I>before</I></B>
submitting your own issue. This helps to prevent issue duplication in
the database.

<P><span class="InputHeader">Permissions and the UNCONFIRMED issue state</span>

<P>
If you have the "Can confirm an issue" permission, then you will be
able to change <span class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span> issues
to the <span class="TypewriterBold">NEW</span> state.

<P>
If you not have the "Can confirm an issue" permission, you can still
<span class="TypewriterBold">ACCEPT</span> or <span
class="TypewriterBold">RESOLVE</span> all issues assigned to
you. IssueZilla keeps track of this. If this issue gets <span
class="TypewriterBold">REOPENED</span> or reassigned to someone else,
it reverts back to the <span class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span>
state. If such an issue <i>has</i> been confirmed, then reassigning
changes its status to <span class="TypewriterBold">NEW</span> or <span
class="TypewriterBold">REOPENED</span>.

<P>
If you have the "Can edit all aspects of any issue" permission, when
you submit issues, these start out in the <span
class="TypewriterBold">NEW</span> state rather than the <span
class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span> state. You can override this
feature, however, when you want to submit an issue as <span
class="TypewriterBold">UNCONFIRMED</span>.
