<H1>Grid Engine Trouble Shooting</H1>
<H2>Problem with a pending jobs not being dispatched</H2>
<P>Sometimes a pending job is obviously runnable, but does not get dispatched.
Grid Engine can be asked for the reason:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>qstat -j &lt;jobid&gt;</P>
	<P>If enabled qstat -j &lt;jobid&gt; provides the user with
	information enlisting the reasons why a certain job has not been
	<I>dispatched in the last scheduling run</I>. This monitoring can be enabled/disabled
	as it can cause undesired communication overhead between Schedd and
	Qmaster (see under 'schedd_job_info' in 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/htmlman5/sched_conf.html?content-type=text/html" NAME="sched_conf">sched_conf(5)</A>
). Here is a
	sample output:</P>
	<PRE>% qstat -j 242059
scheduling info: queue &quot;fangorn.q&quot; dropped because it is temporarily not available
                 queue &quot;lolek.q&quot; dropped because it is temporarily not available
                 queue &quot;balrog.q&quot; dropped because it is temporarily not available
                 queue &quot;saruman.q&quot; dropped because it is full
                 cannot run in queue &quot;bilbur.q&quot; because it is not contained in its hard queue list (-q)
                 cannot run in queue &quot;dwain.q&quot; because it is not contained in its hard queue list (-q)
                 has no permission for host &quot;ori&quot;</PRE>
</UL>
<UL>
	<P>This information is generated directly by Schedd and takes the
	current utilization of the cluster into account. Sometimes this is
	not exactly what you are interested in: E.g. if all queue slots are
	already occupied by jobs of other users, no detailed message is
	generated for the job you are interested in.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>qalter -w v &lt;jobid&gt;</P>
	<P>This command enlists the reasons why a job is not <I>dispatchable in
	principle</I>. For this purpose a dry scheduling run is performed. The
	special with this dry scheduling run is that all consumable
	resources (also slots) are considered to be fully available for this
	job. Similarly all load values are ignored because they are varying.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Job or Queue goes in error state &quot;E&quot;</H2>
<P>Job or queue errors are indicated by an uppercase &quot;E&quot; in the qstat output. 
A job enters the error state when Grid Engine tried to execute a job in a 
queue, but it failed for a reason that is specific to the job. A queue enters the error
state when Grid Engine tried to execute a job in a queue, but it failed for a reason that 
is specific to the queue.</P>
<P>Grid Engine offers a set of possiblities for users and administrators to get diagnosis
information in case of job execution errors. Since both the queue and the job error state 
result from a failed job execution the diagnosis possibilities are applicable to both types
of error states:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>user abort mail</P>
	<P>If jobs are submitted with the submit option &quot;-m a&quot; a abort mail is
   sent to the adress specified with the &quot;-M user[@host]&quot; option. The abort
   mail contains diagnosis information about job errors and are the recommended source
   of information for users.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>qacct accounting</P>
	<P>If no abort mail is available the user can run</P>
   <PRE>qacct -j <jobid></PRE>
	<P>to get information about the job error from Grid Engine job accounting.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>administrator abort mail</P>
	<P>An administrator can order admistrator mails about job execution problems 
   by specifying an appropriate email adress (see under administrator_mail in 
   <A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/htmlman5/sge_conf.html" NAME="sched_conf">sge_conf(5)</A>
  ). Administrator mails contain more detailed diagnosis information than user 
   abort mails and are the recommended in case of frequent job execution errors.
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>messages files</P>
	<P>If no administrator mail is available the Qmasters messages file should 
   be first investigated. Loggings related to a certain job can be found by searching
   for the appropriate job ID. In the 'default' installation the Qmaster messages
   file is located at</P>
   <UL>
      <PRE>$SGE_ROOT/default/spool/qmaster/messages</PRE>
   </UL>
   <P>Additional information can be sometimes found in the messages of the Execd where 
   the job was started. Use qacct -j &lt;jobid&gt; to figure out the host where the job was 
   started and search in</P>

   <UL>
      <PRE>$SGE_ROOT/default/spool/&lt;host&gt;/messages</PRE>
   </UL>

   for the jobid.
