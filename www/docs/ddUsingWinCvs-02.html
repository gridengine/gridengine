      <a name="cvstatus"></a><span class="InputHeader">Finding out file status</span> 
      <p>If you need to find the status of a file relative to the version in the CVS repository, select <strong>Status files</strong> in the <strong>CVS files</strong> menu and select the file. The file's status, working revision number, and repository revision number are displayed in the bottom right-hand pane.

<p>CVS status definitions:
<p>
<dl>
 <dt><i>Locally Added</i></dt>
     <dd>You have added the file with `add', and not yet committed your
     changes.</dd>

	<dt><i>Locally Removed</i></dt>
     <dd>You have removed the file with `remove', and not yet committed
     your changes.</dd>

	<dt><i>Needs Checkout</i></dt>
     <dd>Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository.
     The name is slightly misleading; you will ordinarily use `update'
     rather than `checkout' to get that newer revision.</dd>

   <dt><i>Needs Patch</i></dt>

   <dd>Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send a patch rather
     than the entire file. Sending a patch or sending an entire file
     accomplishes the same thing.</dd>

   <dt><i>Needs Merge</i></dt>
     <dd>Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository, and
     you have also made modifications to the file.</dd>

   <dt><i>File had conflicts on merge</i></dt>

   <dd>This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous `update'
     command gave a conflict and CVS could not resolve the changes made.  If you have not already done so, you need to open the file in an editor and <a href="ddCVS_cvscontributing.html#cvsresolving">resolve the conflict</a>.</dd>

   <dt><i>Unknown</i></dt>
     <dd>CVS doesn't know anything about this file.  For example, you have
     created a new file and have not run `cvs add'.</dd>
  </dl>

      <a name="diff"></a><span class="InputHeader">Comparing different versions 
      of files</span> 
      <p>There may be circumstances when you want to compare the repository version to your file <i>before</i> you commit your changes. Sometimes you may have made some particularly complex modifications to a file that you know someone else has also worked on. Selecting "Diff files..." in the "Cvs files" menu allows you to compare your file against the file in the cvs repository, or against earlier versions.
