   The MIT copyright for Project Athena code.  Note that none of the
   software in the Xmt library uses encryption, so the clause pertaining to
   encryption does not apply.

        Copyright (C) 1990 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

          Export of software employing encryption from the United States of
          America is assumed to require a specific license from the United
          States Government.  It is the responsibility of any person or
          organization contemplating export to obtain such a license before
          exporting.

       distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and
       without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright
       notice appear in all copies and that both that copyright notice and
       this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that
       the name of M.I.T. not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining
       to distribution of the software without specific, written prior
       permission.  M.I.T. makes no representations about the suitability of
       this software for any purpose.  It is provided "as is" without express
       or implied warranty.
   
   The current GUI depends strongly on the Xmt library. A license has been acquired.
   There have been fixes applied coming from the Xmt mailing list and smaller adaptions
   for our convenience.
   Only the GUI is affected.
